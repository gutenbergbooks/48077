<p class="right medium"><span class="smcap">Boston</span>, September 9, 1860.</p>

<p class="dropcap">DEAR SIR,&mdash;With you I hate, deplore, and denounce
the Barbarism of Slavery,&mdash;believing that
the <em>nonentity and impossibility</em> of Slavery under the
Constitution of the United States can be fully seen only
when we fully see its Barbarism; so that in the Constitutional
argument against Slavery the first link is its
essential Barbarism, with the recognition of which no
man will be so absurd as to infer or imagine that Slavery
can have any basis in words which do not plainly
and unequivocally declare it, even if, when thus declared,
it were not at once forbidden by the Divine
Law, which is above all Human Law. Therefore in
much I agree with you, and wish you God-speed.</p>

<p>But I do not agree that the National Government
has power under the Constitution to touch Slavery in
the States, any more than it has power to touch the
twin Barbarism of Polygamy in the States, while fully
endowed to arrest and suppress both in all the Territories.
Therefore I do not join in your special efforts.</p>

<p>But I rejoice in every honest endeavor to expose the
Barbarism which degrades our Republic; and here my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
gratitude is so strong that criticism is disarmed, even
where I find that my judgment hesitates.</p>

<p>Accept my thanks for the invitation with which you
have honored me, and my best wishes for all Constitutional
efforts against Slavery; and believe me, my dear
Sir,</p>

<p class="sig">Very faithfully yours,</p>

Jerry from the hands of slave-hunters.</p>

</div>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="right medium"><span class="smcap">Boston</span>, September 9, 1860.</p>

<p class="dropcap">MY DEAR SIR,&mdash;You know well how much I
sympathize with you personally, and also how
much I detest the Fugitive Slave Bill, as a flagrant violation
of the Constitution, and of the most cherished
human rights,&mdash;shocking to Christian sentiments, insulting
to humanity, and impudent in all its pretensions.
Of course I agree with you that such an
enactment, utterly without support in Constitution,
Christianity, or reason, should not be allowed to remain
on the statute-book; and so long as it is there, I trust
that the honorable, freedom-loving, peaceful, good, and
law-abiding citizens, acting in the name of a violated
Constitution, and for the sake of law, will see that this
infamous counterfeit is made <em>a dead letter</em>. I am happy
to believe that this can be accomplished by an aroused
Public Opinion, which, without violence of any kind,
shall surround every “person” who treads our soil with
all safeguards of the citizen, teaching the Slave-Hunter,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
whenever he shows himself, that he can expect from
Northern men no sympathy or support in his barbarous
pursuit.</p>

<p>At your proposed meeting, which it will not be in
my power to attend, I trust that just hatred of Slavery
in all its pretensions will be subjected to that
temperate judgment which knows how to keep a sacred
animosity within the limits of Constitution and Law.</p>

<p>Accept my thanks for the invitation with which you
have honored me, and believe me, with much personal
regard and constant sympathy,</p>

<h2><a name="EXAMPLE_OF_MASSACHUSETTS_AGAINST" id="EXAMPLE_OF_MASSACHUSETTS_AGAINST"></a>EXAMPLE OF MASSACHUSETTS AGAINST
SLAVERY.</h2>

<p class="plabeln"><span class="smcap">Speech at a Mass Meeting of Republicans, in the Open Air,
at Myrick’s Station, Massachusetts, September 18, 1860.</span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/line.png" width="80" height="16" alt="" />
</div>

<div class="medium">

<p>A large Republican meeting was held in the open air, at Myrick’s
Station, September 18, 1860, in Bristol County, Massachusetts. The
New Bedford and Taunton Branch Railroad, and the Old Colony and
Fall River Railroad, with their branches, were tasked to the utmost in
bringing a crowd estimated at eight thousand. There were large delegations
from New Bedford, Fall River, and Taunton.</p>

<p>Harrison Tweed, of Taunton, was chosen President, with a long list of
Vice-Presidents and Secretaries. The speaking was from a stand in a
beautiful grove. After Hon. Henry L. Dawes and Hon. Henry Wilson,
Mr. Sumner spoke as follows.</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">FELLOW-CITIZENS,&mdash;Knowing well the character
of the good people in the region where we
are assembled, I feel that our cause is safe in your
hands; nor do you need my voice to quicken the generous
zeal which throbs in all your hearts. Proceeding
from intelligence and from conscience, your zeal, I am
sure, is wise, steady, and determined, even if it do not
show itself in much speaking,&mdash;like your own faithful
Representative in Congress, Mr. Buffinton, who never
misses a vote, and whose presence alone is often as
good as a speech. He will pardon me, if I say that I
am glad to see him here among his constituents, so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
many of whom I now meet for the first time face to
face.</p>

<p>You would hardly bear with me, if, on this occasion,
I undertook to occupy your time at length. There is a
time for all things; and let me say frankly, that I have
come here to mingle with my fellow-citizens, and to
partake of their social joy, rather than to make a speech.
And yet I cannot let the opportunity pass without undertaking
for a brief moment to impress upon you our
duties in one single aspect,&mdash;I mean <em>simply as citizens
of Massachusetts</em>. Of course you have duties as men,
belonging to the great human family; you have duties
also as American citizens, belonging to this National
Republic; and you have duties especially as citizens
of Massachusetts, not inconsistent with those other duties,
but merely cumulative and confirmatory. Happily,
in all good governments duties do not clash, but
harmonize; and we may well suspect any pretension,
whatever name it assumes, which cannot bear this
touchstone.</p>

<p>As <em>men</em>, our duties have been grandly denoted in
that ancient verse which aroused the applause of the
Roman theatre:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Myself a man, nought touching man alien to me I deem.”<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">What can be broader or more Christian than this heathen
utterance? Sympathy, kindness, succor are due
from man to man. This is a debt which, though daily
paid, can never be cancelled while life endures. And
this debt has the sanction of Religion, so that wrong to
man is impiety to God. Of course, in the constant discharge
of this debt, we must be the enemies of injustice,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
wherever it shows itself. Nor can we hesitate because
injustice is organized in the name of Law and assumes
the front of Power. On this very account we must be
the more resolute against it.</p>

<p>As citizens of the United States, our duties, fixed in
the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence,
are of the same character. I say, fixed in the Constitution
and the Declaration of Independence; for to these,
as our guides, I look. Follow Nature, if you would be
its interpreter. This is the Novum Organum of Lord
Bacon. And so you must follow the Constitution and
the Declaration of Independence, if you would be their
interpreter. This is the Novum Organum of the Republican
party. Nothing can be clearer than that these
two instruments, if followed to their natural meaning,
are in harmony with all the suggestions of justice and
humanity; so that our duties as men are all reaffirmed
by our duties as American citizens.</p>

<p>And, lastly, as citizens of Massachusetts our duties
are identical, but reinforced by circumstances in her
history; so that, if, as men, or as citizens of the United
States, we hesitate, yet as citizens of Massachusetts we
are not allowed to hesitate. By the example of our
fathers, who laid the foundations of this Commonwealth
in knowledge and in justice, who built schools
and set their faces against Slavery, we are urged to
special effort. As their children, we must strive to develop
and extend those principles which they had so
much at heart, and which constitute their just fame.</p>

<p>In the recent conflicts of party it is common to heap
insult upon Massachusetts. Hard words are often employed.
Some of her own children turn against her.
But it is in vain. From the past learn the future. See<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
how from the beginning she has led the way. This has
been her office. She led in the long battle of argument
which ended in the War of Independence, so that
European historians have called our Revolutionary
Fathers simply “the insurgents of Boston,” and have
announced the object of the war as simply “justice to
Boston.” And she has also led in all enterprises of
human improvement, especially in the establishment
of public schools and the abolition of Slavery. We are
told that a little leaven shall leaven the whole lump;
it is the Massachusetts leaven which is now stirring
the whole country. Wherever education is organized
at the public expense, or human rights are respected,
there is seen the influence of Massachusetts, who has
been not only schoolmaster, but chain-breaker. Such
are her titles. Men may rail, but they cannot rail these
away. Look at them in her history.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In the winter of 1620 the Mayflower landed its
precious cargo on Plymouth Rock. This small band,
cheered by the valedictory prayers of its beloved pastor,
John Robinson, braved sea and wilderness for the
sake of Liberty. In this inspiration our Commonwealth
began. That same year, another cargo, of another character,
was landed at Jamestown in Virginia. It was
twenty slaves,&mdash;the first that ever touched and desecrated
our soil. Never in history was greater contrast.
There was the Mayflower, filled with men, intelligent,
conscientious, prayerful, all braced to hardy industry,
who before landing united in a written compact by
which they constituted themselves “a civil body politic,”
bound “to frame just and equal laws.” And there
was the Slave-Ship, with its fetters, its chains, its bludgeons,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
and its whips,&mdash;with its wretched victims, forerunners
of the long agony of the Slave-Trade, and with
its wretched tyrants, rude, ignorant, profane,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse indent2">“who had learned their only prayers</div>
<div class="verse">From curses,”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">carrying in their hold that barbarous Slavery, <em>whose
single object is to compel labor without wages</em>, which no
“just and equal laws” can sanction. Thus in the same
year began two mighty influences; and these two influences
still prevail far and wide throughout the country.
But they have met at last in final grapple, and
we are partakers in the holy conflict. The question is
simply between the Mayflower and the Slave-Ship,&mdash;which
of the two to choose?</p>

<p>True to her origin, Massachusetts began at once that
noble system of Common Schools which continues her
“peculiar institution,” while a College was founded at
Cambridge which has grown to be a light throughout
the land. Thus together began Common Schools and
the College, and together they have flourished always.
Said one of her early teachers, in most affecting words,&mdash;“After
God had carried us safe to New England,
and we had builded our houses, provided necessaries for
our livelihood, reared convenient places for God’s worship,
and settled the civil government, one of the next
things we longed for and looked after was to advance
learning and perpetuate it to posterity, dreading to
leave an illiterate ministry to the churches when our
present ministers shall lie in the dust.”<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> In this spirit
it was ordered by the General Court, as early as 1642,
“That in every town the chosen men appointed for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
managing the prudential affairs of the same … shall
have power to take account from time to time of all
parents and masters, and of their children, concerning
their calling and employment of their children,
especially of their ability to read and understand the
principles of religion and the capital laws of this country.”<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
This was followed only a few years later, in
1647, by that famous law which ordered, “That every
township in this jurisdiction, after the Lord hath increased
them to the number of fifty householders, shall
then forthwith appoint one within their town to teach
all such children as shall resort to him to write and
read,” and “that, where any town shall increase to the
number of one hundred families or householders, they
shall set up a grammar school, the master thereof being
able to instruct youth so far as they may be fitted for
the University”; and this law, in its preamble, assigned
as its object the counteraction of “one chief project of
that old deluder, Satan, to keep men from the knowledge
of the Scriptures,” and also “that learning may
not be buried in the grave of our fathers in the Church
and Commonwealth.”<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> To nothing in her history can
Massachusetts look with more pride than to this commanding
example, which, wherever followed, must open
wide the gates of human improvement.</p>

<p>Again, mindful that printing is the indispensable
minister of good learning, they established a printing-press
without delay. This was at Cambridge, as early
as 1639, and the first thing printed was “The Freeman’s
Oath.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span></p>

<p>Meanwhile the Slave-Ship continued its voyages and
discharged its baleful cargoes. Virginia became a Slave
State and the natural consequences of Slavery ensued.
Of course the Common School was unknown; for, where
Slavery rules, the schoolmaster is shut out. One of
her Governors, Sir William Berkeley, said in 1671,
“I thank God there are no free schools nor printing,
and I hope we shall not have these hundred years;
for learning has brought disobedience and heresy and
sects into the world, and printing has divulged them
and libels against the best government. God keep us
from both!”<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> These remarkable words, which embodied
the political philosophy of Slavery, were in an
official reply to interrogatories propounded from England.</p>

<p>Thus early was the contrast manifest, which has increased
ever since. The evidence is unimpeachable,
whether we consult the faithful historian who tells us
that early in the last century Boston alone contained
five printing-offices and many booksellers, while there
was not a single bookseller in Virginia, Maryland, or
Carolina,<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>&mdash;or consult the various statistics of the census
in our day, where figures speak with most persuasive
power for the Mayflower against the Slave-Ship.</p>

<p>While Massachusetts thus founded the School and
the Printing-Press, what was her course on Slavery?
Alas! not all that we could wish, but still enough to
make her an example. Unhappily, Slavery, although in
much mitigated form, came to be recognized here. But
it never flourished, and it was from the beginning surrounded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
with impediments to increase. To our glory
let it be known that no person could be born a slave on
our soil. This odious yoke was not transmissible in
the blood. It ended with life, and did not visit itself
upon the children of the slave-mother.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> It appears also
that the slave could take and hold property,<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>&mdash;which
no American slave can now do. He could also testify in
courts of justice, like a white man,&mdash;which no American
slave, nor colored person in a Slave State, can now
do. A slave, called “Andrew, Mr. Oliver Wendell’s
negro,” also “Newtown Prince, a free negro,” and “Cato,
a negro man,” were witnesses in the proceedings against
the British soldiers for what is known as the Boston
Massacre.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> And still further, there were times when
the negro, whether bond or free, was enlisted in the
militia, and “enjoined to attend trainings as well as
the English.”<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> Indeed, as early as 1643, on the muster-roll
of Plymouth is the name of “Abraham Pearse,
the blackamore.”<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> Thus, though Slavery had a certain
recognition, it did not give its unjust law to the body
politic and to the social life of Massachusetts.</p>

<p>It was natural, therefore, that her General Court
should bear witness against “man-stealing.” This it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
did as far back as 1646, in formal act worthy of perpetual
memory. A Boston ship had brought home two
negroes kidnapped on the coast of Guinea. Thus spoke
the Massachusetts of that day:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The General Court, conceiving themselves bound by the
first opportunity to bear witness against the heinous and
crying sin of man-stealing, as also to prescribe such timely
redress for what is past <em>and such a law for the future as may
sufficiently deter all others belonging to us to have to do in such
vile and most odious courses, justly abhorred of all good and
just men</em>, do order that the negro interpreter, with others
unlawfully taken, be, by the first opportunity, at the charge
of the country for present, sent to his native country of
Guinea, and a letter with him of the indignation of the Court
thereabouts, and justice thereof.”<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Mark the energy of this language. Here is an example,
more than a century before Clarkson or Wilberforce,
which blasts with just indignation the horrid crime
still skulking beneath our national flag. The government
that could issue this decree was inconsistent with
itself, when it allowed a single person bearing the upright
form of man to be held a slave, even for life, anywhere
within its jurisdiction.</p>

<p>Slavery flees before the schoolmaster. As early as
1701, its injustice was formally declared by the town of
Boston, whose Records contain the following vote, proper
for adoption at this day: “The Representatives are desired
to promote the encouraging the bringing of white
servants, <em>and to put a period to negroes being slaves</em>.”<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>
By this official corporate act, first of the kind in history,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
Boston stands foremost in the warfare with Slavery.
Let her be proud of this post. Her wealth may depart,
her warehouses may crumble, her ships may cease to
cleave the seas with their keels, and her writers, too,
may lose their charm; but this early record of justice
and humanity will endure in never-failing brightness.</p>

<p>Other official acts followed. In 1705 a heavy duty
was imposed upon every negro imported into Massachusetts.
In 1712 the importation of Indians as servants
or slaves was strictly forbidden. But the small number
of slaves, and the mildness with which their condition
was tempered, or, perhaps, a still immature public
opinion, postponed definitive action on this great
question until our controversy with the mother country,
when the rights of the blacks were blended by all
true patriots with the rights of the whites. James
Otis, in pleading for the Colonies, denounced Slavery of
all kinds, while Samuel Adams, on learning from his
wife that she had received the gift of a female slave,
exclaimed at once, “A slave cannot live in my house;
if she comes, she must be free”: she came, and was
free.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> Sparing all unnecessary details, suffice it to say,
that, as early as 1769, the Superior Court of Massachusetts,
anticipating the renowned judgment in Somerset’s
case, established the principle of Emancipation,
and under its touch of benign power changed a chattel
into a man. In the same spirit voluntary manumissions
took place,&mdash;as by Jonathan Jackson, of Newburyport,
who, in a deed, which may be found in the
Probate Records of the County of Suffolk, declared that
it was “in consideration of the impropriety long felt in
holding any person in constant bondage, more especially<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
at a time when his country is so warmly contending
for the liberty every man ought to enjoy.”<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> At last,
in 1780, even before the triumph of Yorktown had assured
that peace which set its seal upon National Independence,
Massachusetts, enlightened by her common
schools, filled with the sentiment of Freedom, and guided
by Revolutionary patriots, placed in front of her Declaration
of Rights the emphatic words, “All men are
born free and equal,” and by this solemn testimony,
enforced by her courts, made Slavery impossible within
her borders. From that time it ceased to exist, so that
the first census after the adoption of the National Constitution,
in the enumeration of slaves, contains a blank
against the name of Massachusetts; and this is the
only State having this honor. Thus of old did Massachusetts
lead the way.</p>

<p>If all this be good for Massachusetts, if she has
wisely rejected Slavery, then is it her duty to do for
others within the reach of her influence what she has
done for herself. And here her sons have not always
been remiss. Follow her history, and you find that on
the national field they have stood forth for the good
cause. In 1785, one of her Representatives in the
Continental Congress, the eminent Rufus King, moved
the prohibition of Slavery in the Territories of the
United States; and in 1787, Nathan Dane, another of
her Representatives, reported the Ordinance for the
Government of the Northwest Territory, containing this
same prohibition. At a later day, when the Missouri
Compromise was under discussion, that same son of
Massachusetts, Rufus King, whose home was transferred
to New York, showed himself inflexible against compromise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
with Slavery, and in the Senate of the United
States, with all his weight of years, character, and ability,
led the effort to restrict it. John Quincy Adams,
another son of Massachusetts, was at the time Secretary
of State, and he enrolled himself on the same side.
Afterwards, when the discussion of Slavery was renewed
in Congress, this same champion, then a Representative
from Massachusetts, entered the lists for Freedom,
and in his old age, having been President, achieved
a second fame. Slavery, now exalted by its partisans
as beneficent and just, he exposed in its enormity; the
knot of Slave-Masters who had domineered over the
country he denounced with withering scorn; while he
vindicated the right of petition, which Slave-Masters
assailed, and upheld the primal truths of the Declaration
of Independence, which Slave-Masters audaciously
denied. Thus constantly spoke Massachusetts, and in
her voice was the voice of the Mayflower against the
Slave-Ship.</p>

<p>Plainly there is a common bond between the charities,
so that one draws others in its train. And the
grand charity for which we to-day bless our Commonwealth
is only one of many by which she is already
illustrious. Goodness grows by activity, and the moral
and intellectual character which inspired Massachusetts
to do what she has done for Freedom makes her active,
wherever the suffering are to be relieved, wherever the
ignorant are to be taught, or wherever the lowly are to
be elevated, and enables her, though small in extent
and churlish in soil, to exert a wide-spread power.
This character has given her that name on earth which
is a source of pride to her children. Strike out from
her life all that is due to this influence, and how great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
the blank in her history! I do not say that her children
would disown her; but they would hardly rise up
to call her blessed, as they now do.</p>

<p>It is our duty to keep Massachusetts in her present
commanding position,&mdash;true to herself in all respects,&mdash;true
to that Spirit of Liberty in which she had her
origin,&mdash;true to the “just and equal laws” promised
in the Mayflower,&mdash;true to her early and long-continued
efforts against Slavery,&mdash;true to the declaration
in her own Bill of Rights by which Slavery was abolished
within her borders,&mdash;true to the examples of
her illustrious representatives, Rufus King, Nathan
Dane, and John Quincy Adams,&mdash;and, lastly, true to
that moral and intellectual character which has made
her the home of generous charities, the nurse of true
learning, and the land of churches. This is our duty.
And permit me to say, that this can be done now only
by earnest, steadfast effort to arrest the power of Slavery,
overshadowing the whole country, and menacing
boundless regions with its malign influence. And this
is the very purpose of the Republican party.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Against the Republican party are arrayed three factions,
differing in name, differing superficially in professions,
but all concurring in hostility to the Prohibition
of Slavery in the Territories, and therefore all
three Proslavery. As the Republican party represents
the Mayflower, so do these three factions, whether fused
or apart, represent the original Slave-Ship,&mdash;and you,
fellow-citizens, are here to choose between them.</p>

<p>In this contest we appeal to all good citizens. We
appeal alike to the Conservative and to the Reformer;
for our reasonable and most moderate purpose commends<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
itself alike to both. To the Conservative it says,
“Join us to preserve the work of our fathers, and to
maintain the time-honored policy of Massachusetts.”
To the Reformer it says, “Join us to improve the
human family, to support free labor, and to save the
Territories from that deplorable condition where ‘one
man ruleth over another to his own hurt,’ and human
character suffers as much from the arrogance of the
master as from the abasement of the slave,&mdash;a condition
which is founded on nothing else but force,&mdash;</p>

<p>Our course is commended also by our candidates.
Of Mr. Lincoln and Mr. Hamlin I have already elsewhere
spoken, and know that in this presence it is
needless to speak of Mr. Andrew. You all anticipate
his praise before it can be uttered. Of unquestioned
abilities, extensive attainments, and rare aptitude for
affairs, his integrity has already passed into a proverb,
and his broad sympathies cause us to forget the lawyer
in the man. Nobody questions his intelligence, or the
happy faculties which make him at home in all that he
attempts. But it is sometimes complained that he has
a “heart,” as if this were dangerous in a Massachusetts
Governor; and fears are excited because he is “honest,”
as if such a character could not be trusted. Thank
God, he has a heart, and is an honest man. In these
respects, and in his well-matured convictions, always
expressed with honorable frankness, he embodies the
historic idea of Massachusetts, and treads in the footsteps
of the Fathers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span></p>

<p>Fellow-citizens, if I have dwelt exclusively on our
duties as citizens of Massachusetts, it is because I seek
to impress these especially upon your minds. On other
occasions I have treated other parts of the argument;
but to-day my hope is to make you feel that you cannot
turn from the Republican party without turning also
from those principles by which Massachusetts has won
her place in history, and without turning from the Mayflower,
and its promise of “just and equal laws,” to embark
on that dismal Slave-Ship which in the same year
first let loose upon our country all the cruel wrongs and
woes of Human Bondage.</p>

<p class="right medium"><span class="smcap">Boston</span>, September 19, 1860.</p>

<p class="dropcap">MY DEAR SIR,&mdash;Surely the statue of Horace
Mann ought to be made, and you are right in
appealing for contributions to those who have been especially
benefited by his noble labors. When I think
of their extent and variety, embracing every question
of human improvement, I feel that there are none to
whom this appeal may not be confidently addressed.</p>

<p>I know nothing more appropriate or touching than
the contributions you are gathering from the schools.
It is true that there is no school in Massachusetts which
has not been improved by his labors, and therefore
no pupil or teacher who is not his debtor. But it is
pleasant to feel that this debt is recognized.</p>

<p>I doubt not that every child who gives his “mite”
will be happy hereafter in the thought, especially when
he looks at the statue in the public grounds of the
Commonwealth. He will of course have new interest
in the man, and therefore a new and quickening
example of excellence, which may send its influence
through life. The teacher, besides sharing these feelings
with the pupil, must look with grateful pride upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
a tribute which, so long as it endures, will proclaim the
dignity of his profession.</p>

<p>The engraving of Mr. Mann is faithful and agreeable.
I hope it may be in every school, so that children may
early learn the countenance of their benefactor.</p>

<p>Mr. Sumner delivered the opening address for the season in the
“Fraternity” Lectures, established by the Society bearing that name,
of which Theodore Parker was the much-loved pastor. Before proceeding
with his address he made a brief allusion to the great preacher and
reformer. This was in the Tremont Temple. According to a newspaper
of the time, “the immense hall was crowded in every part;
not only were all the seats occupied, but also all available standing-room.”
“Mr. Sumner spoke two hours and five minutes, and commanded
the entire attention of the audience to the close,” and “was
frequently interrupted by the most enthusiastic applause.”</p>

<p>The address of the evening, on Lafayette, was again delivered a few
weeks later in New York, and will be found in this collection at that
date. The introductory words are given here.</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Fellow-Citizens, Ladies, and Gentlemen</span>:&mdash;</p>

<p class="dropcap">In opening this course of lectures, devoted to Human
Improvement, I cannot forget that noble spirit, especially
dear to many of you as pastor, whom we had
hoped to welcome at this time in restored health, instead
of mourning dead in a distant land. I knew him
well, and never came within his influence without confessing
his many-sided powers, his marvellous acquirements,
his rare eloquence, his soul touched to so many
generous sympathies, and his heart beating warm for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
his fellow-men. To the cause of Human Improvement,
in every form, his life was given. For this he labored;
for this he died.</p>

<p>It was my fortune to see him during several days in
Paris, some time after he parted from you. He had
recently arrived from the West Indies. I feel that I
cannot err in offering a slight reminiscence of that meeting.
I found him the same in purpose and aspiration
as I had always known him,&mdash;earnest, thoughtful, and
intent on all that helped the good of man, with the
same completeness of intelligence, and the same large,
loving heart. We visited together ancient by-ways
and historic scenes of that wonderful metropolis, which
no person was more forward to appreciate and to enjoy;
but, turning from these fascinating objects, his conversation
took the wings of the morning, and, traversing
the Atlantic, rested on our own country, on friends at
home, on his relations to his parishioners, on his unfinished
labors, and on that great cause of Liberty, which
contains all other causes, as the greater contains the
less; for where Liberty is not, what is man, whether
slave or master? Observing him carefully, with the
fellow-feeling of a convalescent, I was glad and surprised
to find in him so many signs of health. At that
time he was stronger than I was; but he has been taken,
and I am spared. Indeed, it was only in the husky
whisper of his voice that he seemed weak. I envied
him much his active step and his power to walk. But
he had measured his forces, and calmly revealed to me
his doubt whether he should live to see home again.
If this were permitted, he did not expect to resume his
old activities, but thought that in some quiet retreat,
away from paved streets, surrounded by books, he might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
perhaps have strength to continue some of his labors, to
bind up some of his sheaves, and occasionally to speak
with his pen. But it was ordered otherwise. Not even
this moderate anticipation was gratified. The fatal disease
had fastened too surely upon him, and was slowly
mastering all resistance. The devotion of friends, travel,
change of scene, the charms of Switzerland, the classic
breath of Italy, all were in vain. It was his wish that
he should be buried where he fell, and this child of
New England, the well-ripened product of her peculiar
life, now sleeps in Tuscan earth, on the banks of the
Arno, near the sepulchres of Michel Angelo and Galileo.
But I know not if even this exalted association
can make us content to renounce the pious privilege of
laying him in one of our own tombs, among the people
that he loved so well.</p>

<p>Pardon me for thus renewing your grief. But I felt
that I could not address you on any other subject until
I had mingled my feelings with yours, and our hearts
had met in sympathy for our great bereavement.</p>

Hon. Henry Wilson, and John A. Andrew, Esq., the Republican candidate
for Governor. The report at the time says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“While Mr. Wilson was speaking, Hon. Charles Sumner arrived upon the
ground, and, on stepping upon the platform, was greeted with great applause.
At the close of the speech of Mr. Wilson, the President presented
Mr. Sumner, who was received with nine hearty cheers. After silence was
obtained, Mr. Sumner addressed the meeting.”</p>

</div>

<p>This speech was quoted as the Framingham Speech by M. Cochin,
the philanthropic Frenchman, in his important work, <i>L’Abolition de
l’Esclavage</i>.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<p class="dropcap">FELLOW-CITIZENS,&mdash;The German Siebold begins
his great treatise on the “Anatomy of the Invertebrates”
with this general remark:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The <em>Invertebrate</em> animals are organized after various
types, the limits of which are not always clearly defined.
There is, therefore, a greater number of classes among them
than among the <em>Vertebrates</em>.”</p>

</div>

<p>In this remark of the illustrious naturalist I find
an explanation of the number of parties now arrayed
against us. On one side is the Republican party,
openly declaring its principles, and looking with confidence
to the Future. Threats of disunion, and menaces
of violence, in constant cry, do not disturb it. Such a
party may properly be called the <em>Backbone party</em>, or,
adopting the phraseology of the German naturalist, the
party of the <em>Vertebrates</em>.</p>

<p>But against the Republican party here in Massachusetts
are three parties, or factions rather, which cannot
be precisely named except from their candidates.
Differing from each other superficially, they all concur
in practical support of Slavery. At this moment,
when the propagandists of Slavery insist upon its extension
into the Territories, all these three factions
lend themselves actively or passively to this work, and
thus become practically Proslavery. Unwilling here
in Massachusetts openly to advocate a wrong so unmistakable
as Slavery, they find excuse in alleged danger
to the Union, and bend before the threats and
menaces of Slave-Masters. Not in the name of Freedom,
which is really in danger, but in the name of
the Union, which is only threatened, do they all three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
rally against the Republican party. In their flexibility
to threats and menaces, they show a want of that
backbone which characterizes the Republican party.
In short, though differing from each other, they all
take their place among <em>Invertebrates</em>, which, according
to the naturalist, are of more various types than <em>Vertebrates</em>.</p>

<p>There is the Bell faction, the Breckinridge faction,
and the Douglas faction, all three <em>Invertebrates</em>, declaring
that the Union is in danger, and asking your votes
in order to save it. That is, they ask you to abandon
cherished convictions, and to allow Slavery, with all its
Barbarism, to enter the outlying Territories of the Republic,
simply because certain Slave-Masters threaten
disunion. Instead of opposing the treason which is
threatened, Freedom-loving voters of the North are
summoned to surrender. Instead of scorning the violence
which is menaced, we are asked to cringe before
it. I ask you if this is not the special point of
every appeal by any speaker representing either of
these factions? No man so audacious here in Massachusetts
as to argue for Slavery openly. He knows
that his argument would be scouted. It is therefore
by appeal for the Union that people are deluded. In
this way the weak are cajoled, the timeserving are seduced,
and the timid are frightened; and people professing
opposition to Slavery gravely come forward as
supporters of these Proslavery factions.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The unknown is apt to be exaggerated; so that, if
these threats of disunion were now heard for the first
time, we might, perhaps, pardon men who yield to
their influence. But since this is not the first time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
such cries are heard,&mdash;since, indeed, they have been
long sounding in our ears, so that their exact value is
perfectly understood from the very beginning,&mdash;there
seems no longer excuse or apology for hearkening to
them. They are to be treated as threats, and nothing
more. Look at them from the outset, and you will see
their constant recurrence as weapons of political warfare.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Even while the Constitution was under discussion in
the National Convention, the threats began. Georgia
and South Carolina announced that they would not
come into the Union, unless the African Slave-Trade,
so dear in their sight, was allowed for twenty years
under the Constitution; and the North ignominiously
yielded this barbarous privilege, thus consenting to piracy.
The cry from these States was then, “We will
not come in.” Ever since it has been, “We will not
stay in.”</p>

<p>One of the earliest and most characteristic outcries
was on the ratification of Jay’s Treaty in 1795. This
famous treaty, negotiated by John Jay, at that time
Chief Justice of the United States, under the instructions
of Washington, provided for the surrender of the
Western posts by Great Britain, and indemnity to our
merchants for spoliations on their commerce, and also
the adjustment of claims of British merchants upon
our citizens. In the opposition which it encountered
we meet the following threat of disunion in Virginia,
published in Davis’s Gazette, at Richmond.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Notice is hereby given, that, in case the treaty entered
into by that d&mdash;d arch-traitor, J&mdash;n J&mdash;y, with the British
tyrant should be ratified, a petition will be presented to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
the General Assembly of Virginia, at their next session,
praying that the said State may <em>recede</em> [such was the word
in that early day] from the Union, and be left under the
government and protection of one hundred thousand free
and independent Virginians.</p>

<p>“P. S.&mdash;As it is the wish of the people of the said State
to enter into a treaty of amity and commerce and navigation
with any other State or States of the present Union
who are averse to returning again under the galling yoke of
Great Britain, the printers of the (at present) United States
are requested to publish the above notification.”<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Thus early was this menace tried. But the treaty
was ratified.</p>

<p>The menace was employed with more effect to secure
the adoption of the Missouri Compromise. This was in
1820. Missouri applied for admission into the Union
as a Slaveholding State. Her admission was opposed
by the North on the declared ground that it was not
right to give any such sanction to Slavery. Thus the
whole Slave Question was opened; and it was discussed
with much thoroughness and ability, under the lead of
Rufus King, once an eminent representative of Massachusetts,
but at that time a venerable Senator from
New York. Overthrown in argument, the Slave-Masters
resorted to threats of disunion. The Union was pronounced
in danger, and under this cry a compromise,
first suggested in the House by Louis McLane, a Representative
from Delaware, and in the Senate by William
Pinkney, a Senator from Maryland, was adopted, by virtue
of which Missouri was admitted as a Slave State,
while Slavery was prohibited in the remaining territory<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
north of 36° 30´, at that time trodden only by Indians.
The special operative gain to the Slave-Masters was the
admission of Missouri as a Slave State, with two new
slaveholding Senators to confirm their predominance
in the Senate; and this was notoriously secured under
threats of disunion, by which weak men at the North
were intimidated.</p>

<p>A record at the time by the late Mr. Justice Story,
who was then at Washington, shows the temper especially
of Virginia. Writing to a friend at home, he
says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Mr. Randolph, in the House of Representatives, made a
furious attack upon all who advocated the Compromise. He
said: ‘The land is <em>ours</em> [meaning Virginia’s], and we will
have it, and hold it, and use it as we [Virginians] please.’
He abused all the Eastern States in the most bitter style,
and intimated in the most direct manner that he would
have nothing to do with them. ‘We,’ said he, ‘will not
cut and deal with them, but will put our hands upon our
pockets and have nothing to do in this game with them.’
His speech was a very severe philippic, and contained a
great many offensive allusions. <em>It let out the great secrets
of Virginia, and blabbed that policy by which she has hitherto
bullied us, and led us, and wheedled us, and governed us.</em> You
would not have supposed that there was a State in the
Union entitled to any confidence or character, except Virginia.”<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Such is the testimony of a tranquil observer, friend
and associate of that illustrious Virginian, John Marshall,
who witnessed this manifestation of the bullying
spirit, and judged it.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span></p>
<p>Ten years passed, from 1820 to 1830, and the cry was
raised again. It was now on the allegation of injustice
in our Tariff. Here South Carolina took the lead, and
openly threatened Nullification,&mdash;in the face of the
arguments of Daniel Webster and the proclamations
of Andrew Jackson. A modification of the tariff became
necessary before this cry of “wolf” ceased. General
Jackson, in a private letter written at the time, and
now in the possession of our candidate, Mr. Andrew,
predicts that “the Negro Question” will be the next
occasion for it;<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> and he was right.</p>

<p>The subject of Slavery came up in Congress on
petitions as early as 1835, and then commenced the
great career of John Quincy Adams, as champion of
Freedom, eclipsing even all his glories as diplomatist
and President. At the presentation of petitions by this
illustrious statesman, the old threats were revived; and
falling before them, the Right of Petition itself was sacrificed.
You all remember the depth of this humiliation.</p>

<p>This was followed by still another, on the introduction
of the Wilmot Proviso, which was simply a proposition
to prohibit Slavery in the Territories. The same
threats broke forth with increased violence. Citizens
at the North, while avowing hostility to Slavery, professed
to be alarmed for the Union. Again they bowed,
and in 1850 assisted in those Acts of Compromise, by
which the Territories of Utah and New Mexico were
left open to Slavery, and a Fugitive Slave Bill was
passed, outraging alike every principle of Constitutional
Liberty and every sentiment of Humanity. Here was
surrender to this cry.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span></p>
<p>The menace of disunion at the South became chronic.
Not a day passed that it was not uttered. At length,
in 1856, John C. Fremont was nominated as candidate
for the Presidency by the Republican party. As
his election seemed at hand, we were again encountered
by the same old threats. We were told, that,
even if elected according to the forms of the Constitution,
the Slave-Masters would not allow him to be
inaugurated, and people at the North were summoned
ignominiously to vote against him for the safety of
the Union; and they surrendered to the call. Without
this, John C. Fremont would have been chosen
President. Thus again did the old menace prevail;
and the chronic cry still continued, showing itself on
the election of a Speaker, and then on the approval
of Mr. Helper’s book by sixty-seven Members of Congress.<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<p>And now Abraham Lincoln is the candidate, instead
of John C. Fremont. Again the threats are renewed
with increased animosity, and you are asked
to vote against a statesman of marked abilities and
blameless character, representing the early sentiments
of the Fathers, simply because Slave-Masters menace
disunion in the event of his election. Bending with
<em>invertebrate</em> backs before these threats, you are called
to surrender your principles, your votes, and your
souls.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Thus seven times, at seven different stages in our
history, since the adoption of the Constitution, has
this menace of disunion been made to play its part.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
Whatever it might have been at first, it is now nothing
more than “second childishness and mere oblivion,
<i>sans</i> everything.” There is nothing in it which should
not be treated with indignant contempt, certainly when
employed here in Massachusetts to make us sacrifice
our principles.</p>

<p>Absurd on the face, its absurdity is fully appreciated
only when we consider its impotence as a remedy
for the alleged grievances of the Slave States. They
complain that fugitive slaves are not faithfully surrendered,&mdash;or,
in other words, that some score or two of
human beings, following the North Star, with the assistance
of Northern men, succeed in securing their freedom.
But disunion surely would be a poor remedy
for this intolerable grievance; for it would leave them
without even their present protection in this respect,
without a Fugitive Slave Bill, or any constitutional
safeguard, so that all fugitives, just so soon as they
crossed the frontiers of the Slave States, would become
free,&mdash;precisely as if Canada, with its British welcome
to slaves, were carried down to the borders of Virginia
and Maryland. If slaves escape now, what would they
do then? If such things are done in the green tree,
what would be done in the dry? Surely, in this case,
it were better to</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse indent6">“bear the ills they have</div>
<div class="verse">Than fly to others that they know not of.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The other grievance is of the same character. The
Slave-Masters complain, that, by the prohibition of
Slavery in the Territories, they are deprived of the
opportunity of new Slave States through which their
predominance in the Senate may be continued. But,
pray, what remedy for this loss can be found in disunion?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
Surely they cannot add to their present political
strength by renouncing securities and dignities
which they now enjoy in the national copartnership.
It is true, that, while in the Union, they may be voted
down on matters within the national jurisdiction and
outside of the States; but they may nevertheless exert
an influence, which on their withdrawal must be entirely
renounced.</p>

<p>Such are the two grievances which are to justify disunion;
and pardon me, if I venture to illustrate the
irrational character of this remedy by an incident of
scientific interest. The monkey in the <i>Jardin des
Plantes</i> at Paris was found biting the rope by which he
was suspended from the roof. “See,” said the learned
professor, “that monkey shows the difference between
brutes and men. He sees what he is doing, but does
not see the consequence,&mdash;that down he will fall.”
And the Slave States also bite the rope by which they
are suspended, and, like the unreasoning brute, see not
the consequence.</p>

<p>Yet more apparent is the absurdity of this threat,
when we consider how it is to be accomplished. If
the Slave States were solemnly unanimous at home,
the cry might have a certain force. But it is well
known that they are not unanimous. Whatever the
threats of disorganizing extremists, the large mass of
people even in the Slave States do not desire disunion.
They keep aloof now from such threats, and openly
declare their purpose to put down the traitors without
assistance from the North; and this I cannot
doubt would be done. Such men as Cassius M. Clay
and the Blairs would find a field for their energies,
and they would see at their side people who have not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
hitherto acted with them gladly forgetting past differences
for the sake of a common cause. Here are emphatic
words, just uttered by a speaker at the South,
in reply to Mr. Yancey, which show that any such
attempt would fare badly, even at home:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I am one of a numerous party at the South, who will,
if even Lincoln shall be elected under the forms of our
Constitution and by the authority of law, without committing
any other offence than being elected, force the vile disunionists
and secessionists of the South to pass over our
dead bodies in their march to Washington to break up
this government.”</p>

</div>

<p>But the absurdity of this threat glares upon us still
more, when we reflect on the unhappy condition in
which disunion would leave the seceding Slave States.
Antiquity, by numerous instances, declares the danger
from slaves, and history is continually verifying this
truth. Even now, while I speak, we hear of insurrection
at Norfolk, in Virginia, carrying with it wide-spread
alarm, and the necessity for most especial vigilance.
But in the event of disunion this condition
would become permanent, so that life, if not a tragedy,
would be a penance long drawn out. The whole
region cursed with Slavery would be dotted over with
fortifications and military posts; communities would
be changed into camps carefully guarded against surprise;
life would be as in Turkey or Tartary; and every
Slave-Master would sleep with all the precautions
of a highwayman fearing arrest, or of the mad prince,
Don Carlos of Spain, who had two naked swords and
two loaded pistols under his bed, and two arquebuses
with powder and balls in his closet. The mother, as she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
heard the fire-bell at midnight, would clasp her infant
to her breast, fearful that at last the long hoarded resentments
of the slave would be vindictively indulged.
Even the soil, now so productive, would refuse its increase;
for Nature herself would cease to smile amidst
the alarms of servile war. Thus cruelly harassed and
impoverished at home, the Slave States could find little
comfort abroad. For a brief moment they might
brave the scorn and contempt poured upon them; but
they must fail to have the sensibilities of men, or they
would at last shrink before the finger-point of the civilized
world. The house of Lycaon, the cruel king of
early Greece, was destroyed by the thunder of Jove, and
the miserable monarch changed to a wolf. Such would
be the doom of a State which set at defiance the laws of
Humanity. It would have a <em>wolf’s head</em>, and all would
be against it.</p>

<p>The States which especially threaten secession are
on the Mexican Gulf, and they have become known
already as “The Gulf Squadron.” Not yet wolves, they
are now ships. Let them sail, with the black flag at
the mast-head. I know not how the tale would end,
but I know well that Slavery could not gain. Their
dismal fate is, perhaps, prefigured in that of the slaver
loaded down with its human cargo, where the crew
were all struck with ophthalmia, and in this condition
of blindness, while vainly striving to navigate the
vessel, and weltering on the sea, were at last picked up
by a charitable cruiser and carried into port. Or perhaps
it is prefigured in that of the famous craft known
in story as “The Flying Dutchman,” which, darkened
by piracy and murder, was doomed to perpetual cruise,
unable to enter a port:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">

</div>
</div>

<p>Such is Disunion, in the history of its threats,&mdash;also
in the reasons now alleged for it, the difficulties in its
way, and its dismal consequences. But in all these
aspects, from the beginning, we find but one supreme
absurdity. It is the same, whether we ask Why? How?
or What?</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>And yet you and I here in Massachusetts are summoned,
under threats of disunion, to withdraw opposition
to the extension of Slavery, and in token thereof
to vote for Bell, or Breckinridge, or Douglas. I can
do no such thing; nor do I see how any Northern
man, with a head on his shoulders, or a heart in his
bosom, or a backbone in his body, can do any such
thing. Nor must fealty to the Union be measured
by loud-mouthed profession. Not Cordelia, loving her
father, in all simplicity, “according to her bond,” but
the sisters Goneril and Regan, so fervent in professions,
sacrificed him. And I do not hesitate to declare
that the Republican party is the only true Union
party. In the first place, it is the only party which
is not connected in some way, by association, affiliation,
communion, or sympathy, with disunionists; and,
in the second place, it is the only party which seeks
the establishment of those national principles of Freedom
on which the Union was originally founded, and
without which it cannot exist in security or honor.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span></p>
<p>As it is the only Union party, so the Republican
party is the only Constitutional party. It is the only
party which takes the Constitution unreservedly as
guide, according to the spirit in which it was made, and
the light of its Preamble,&mdash;rejecting the Proslavery
interpretations adopted by the Bell faction, the Breckinridge
faction, and the Douglas faction, all of which,
in whatever form, are abhorrent to the spirit of the Constitution
and the very words of its Preamble. In that
Preamble it is declared that the Constitution is made
to “establish justice, insure domestic tranquillity, provide
for the common defence, promote the general welfare,
and secure the blessings of Liberty to ourselves
and our posterity.” Mark these important words. It is
to establish justice: but Slavery is injustice. It is to
insure domestic tranquillity: but Slavery insures domestic
discord and insurrection. It is to provide for
the common defence: but Slavery causes common
weakness. It is to promote the general welfare: but
Slavery perils the general welfare. Finally, it is to secure
the blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our posterity:
but Slavery sacrifices these blessings. Such is
the Preamble, which is the key to the Constitution.
The Republican party alone adopts its principles, as it
alone adopts most honestly and sincerely the often declared
opinions of its founders. Therefore it is the only
Constitutional party.</p>

<p>For the Union and the Constitution, the Republican
party is also the only party which maintains the great
principles of Human Freedom. Thus in every respect
is it commended to your support. The man who asks
you here in Massachusetts to vote against it is either
very weak, and believes in his own bad reasoning, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
very artful, and laughs in his sleeve at your credulity,
or very spiteful, and allows all things, even his principles
and his country, to be lost in the gratification of
a vindictive temper. Look at your opponents here, and
you will find that weakness, duplicity, and spite are
the three main springs to their conduct. This is a severe
analysis, but I think the facts support the assertion.</p>

<p>Frankness is not a virtue of our opponents, else we
should have this issue between us more fairly stated.
But you will not be deceived. You will see, that,
amidst all disguises and subterfuges, the great question
perpetually recurs: Are you for Freedom, or are
you for Slavery? On this single question you are to
vote; and no cry of “Disunion” can change the issue.
Are you for Freedom in the Territories? Are you
for a National Government administered in the spirit
of the Fathers? Are you for the prostration of the
Slave Oligarchy which now rules the country? Vain
is the attempt to interpose other questions, even that
of the Union itself; and vain is the attempt to separate
the combatants. The ancient armies of Rome
and Carthage fought on, unconscious of an earthquake
which upheaved mountains, toppled down cities, and
turned the course of rivers. But the animosity between
Freedom and Slavery is not less implacable
and self-forgetful. It can end only with the triumph
of Freedom.</p>

<p>Freedom, which is the breath of God, is a great leveller;
but it raises where it levels. Slavery, which is the
breath of Satan, is also a great leveller; but it degrades
everything, carrying with it master as well as slave.
Choose ye between them; and remember that your first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
duty is to stand up straight, and not bend before absurd
threats, whether uttered at the South or repeated here
in Massachusetts. Let people cry, “Disunion.” We
know what the cry means, and we answer back: The
Union shall be preserved, and made more precious by
its consecration to Freedom.</p>

<p class="plabeln"><span class="smcap">Speech in the Mechanics’ Hall, Worcester, November 1, 1860.</span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/line.png" width="80" height="16" alt="" />
</div>

<div class="medium">

<p>This speech was made on the eve of the Presidential election, with
the special purpose of sustaining Hon. Goldsmith F. Bailey, the Republican
candidate for Congress in the Worcester District, against
Hon. Eli Thayer, the previous Representative, who, failing to obtain
the Republican nomination, became an Independent candidate. When
it was known that Mr. Sumner had accepted an invitation from the
Republican Committee to speak in the District, Mr. Thayer addressed
him a letter, proposing a public discussion together on an evening
named. To this challenge Mr. Sumner promptly replied in the following
letter.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="right medium"><span class="smcap">Boston</span>, October 30, 1860.</p>

<p class="dropcap">MY DEAR SIR,&mdash;I make haste to acknowledge
your favor of 29th October, that I may not seem
for a moment to fail in any courtesy towards you.</p>

<p>I have been invited by the Republicans of Worcester
to address them in support of their candidate, and have
not felt at liberty to decline the invitation. But I
should not like to take part in any controversy with
an Opposition candidate, even had I been invited to
do so.</p>

<p>Accept the good wishes which I sincerely cherish for
your personal welfare, and believe me, dear Sir,</p>

<p class="sig">Faithfully yours,</p>

<p class="sig2"><span class="smcap">Charles Sumner</span>.</p>

<p class="noindent medium"><span class="smcap">Hon. Eli Thayer.</span></p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Sumner, yielding with reluctance to the pressure upon him,
consented to speak on this occasion, solely with the desire of striking a
last blow at a political heresy which stood in the way of establishing
Freedom in the Territories, and of helping to save an important District
of Massachusetts from being represented by one of its partisans. The
speech is confined exclusively to the dogma or device of Popular Sovereignty,
often called Squatter Sovereignty, in the Territories, which,
after playing a conspicuous part in other sections of the country, at
last found a supporter in Mr. Thayer, who gave to it certain importance,
inasmuch as he had already done excellent service in organizing
that Liberty-loving emigration which contributed so powerfully to the
salvation of Kansas.</p>

<p>Though local in its immediate influence, the speech completes the
series of efforts by which Mr. Sumner sought to fix the power of Congress
to prohibit Slavery in the Territories, which was the great issue
in the Presidential election. It is, perhaps, the last speech made anywhere
on this topic, which unquestionably belongs to the history of the
Slavery Question in our country. At its delivery there was much
enthusiasm. The large hall was crowded for an hour before the meeting.
Many hundreds, some from a distance, were compelled to return
home, while others thronged the aisles and passage-ways. The effect
of the speech was attested at the time by the public press, and also by
correspondents. Mr. Bailey, the successful candidate, wrote as follows,
under date of Fitchburg, November 10, 1860.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Our District was carried on high points. Our triumph is one of principle.
We were in danger at one time, and felt the need of a strong, manly
blow from an authoritative source. You gave such a blow, and the result
is, Mr. Thayer has a plurality in but eight of the thirty-seven towns comprising
our District.</p>

<p>“The victory is not in any sense a personal one for me. But, as a member
of the Republican party, a lover of the principles of personal liberty cherished
by the Fathers, and an enemy of human slavery in all forms and <em>everywhere</em>,
I must thank you from a full heart for the great and timely aid you then
rendered to the cause in this District. Your reward, I know, is not in these
thanks, but it is a satisfaction to me to express them.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I cannot refrain from tendering to you personally my heartfelt thanks
for your masterly speech in Mechanics’ Hall, which, in my opinion, did
more to avert our threatened defeat than any other instrumentality employed.
In saying this, I would not for a moment disparage any effort put
forth by others; but, having devoted my whole soul to the contest, having
expended every effort of mind and body, and believing that I <em>know</em>, as well,
if not better, than others engaged in the fight, to whom the laurels really
belong, I cannot repress avowal of the conviction, that, but for your speech,
the event would have been at least doubtful. I am impelled to tender you
my warmest personal gratitude for efforts which others halted and hesitated

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Fellow-Citizens of Worcester</span>:&mdash;</p>

<p class="dropcap">On my way to this place, my attention was attracted
by a banner, flaunting over the highway, with
these words: “<span class="smcap">Trust the People</span>.” Nothing could be
fairer or more seductive. In those simple words is
embodied a principle, long unknown, and to this day
often denied, which may be called the mainspring of
Democratic institutions. Here is an implied assertion
of the right of the people to govern themselves. And
here also is an implied denial of all pretensions of Tyranny
and Oligarchy. Such a principle, properly understood
in its simplicity and just limitations, must
find welcome in every Republican breast. Reading it
on the banner, I responded with joy: “‘Trust the People,’
and Might will no longer make Right, Government
everywhere will be founded upon the consent of
the governed, and Slavery will become impossible!”</p>

<p>Studying the banner further, I found written above
this fair device the names, “<span class="smcap">Douglas and Johnson</span>.”
And then I was saddened to see how here in Massachusetts
a great principle of human rights is degraded
to be a cover for the denial of all rights. Of course
the principles of these two candidates are understood.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
Mr. Douglas, with vulgar insensibility to what is due to
all who wear the human form, openly declares that “at
the North he is for the white man against the <em>nigger</em>,
but that further South he is for the <em>nigger</em> against the
alligator,”&mdash;and in this spirit says, “Vote Slavery up
or vote Slavery down”; and such is the Popular Sovereignty
which he proclaims. Mr. Johnson, who is his
associate, declares, in well-known words, that “Capital
ought to own Labor,”&mdash;that is, that mechanics, workmen,
and farmers, in fine, all who toil with hands,
should be slaves; and this is the Popular Sovereignty
which he proclaims. Surely this Douglas and Johnson
Popular Sovereignty should rather be called Popular
Tyranny. And here at the outset you will observe
a wide distinction. Sovereignty is properly limited by
<em>right</em>; Tyranny is without any limit except <em>force</em>. But
when presented under the captivating device of “Trust
the people,” its true character is concealed. It is the
Devil radiant with the face of an angel. It is an apple
of Sodom, fair to the eye, but dust and ashes to the
touch.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>There are few among us who avow themselves supporters
of Douglas and Johnson; or if they do, they
have ceased to look for success in the coming Presidential
election, which seems to be practically decided
already. I should not be justified, therefore, in occupying
your time to-night in considering their cunning
artifice, if it were represented only by Douglas and
Johnson, against whom you all stand ready to vote. To
argue against these candidates here in Massachusetts,
and especially in Worcester County, is as superfluous
as to argue against King George the Third, whose ideas<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
of sovereignty were of the same tyrannical class, yet
who was dead long ago.</p>

<p>But the same popular tyranny, misnamed Popular
Sovereignty, upheld by these Presidential candidates,
is also upheld by another candidate, now seeking your
votes as Representative to Congress. Let me not do
injustice to Mr. Thayer. I know well the points of
difference between his theory and the theory of Douglas
and Johnson; but I know also that in essential
character they are identical,&mdash;so much so, that Mr.
Douglas is reported to have hailed him, at the close of
one of his speeches, as an authoritative expounder of
the theory. The ancient Athenian, when praised in a
certain quarter, exclaimed, “What bad thing have I
done?” And Mr. Thayer, in earlier days, when doing
so much for Freedom, would have been apt to turn
from such praise with a similar exclamation.</p>

<p>It was natural that Mr. Douglas should praise him;
for he gave the influence of character and ability to
that pretension on which this reckless adventurer had
staked his political fortunes. The fundamental principle
of each is, that the question of Slavery in a distant
Territory shall be taken from Congress and referred
to the handful of squatters in the Territory, who,
in the exercise of a sovereignty inherent in the people,
and therefore called Popular Sovereignty, may “vote
Slavery up or vote Slavery down.” Of course Mr.
Thayer, thanks to his New England home, has too
much good taste to put forth this pretension in the
brutal form it often assumes, when advanced by Mr.
Douglas. He does not say that he is “for the white
man against the <em>nigger</em> and for the <em>nigger</em> against the
alligator.” Perhaps the pretension becomes more dangerous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
because presented in more plausible form, and
made part of a more comprehensive system. All that
Mr. Douglas claims for the squatters, in the exercise
of Popular Sovereignty, is power over Slavery, and
other domestic institutions; while Mr. Thayer claims
for them, besides this power, the power also to choose
their own officers, instead of receiving them from Washington.
But the essential distinctive pretension of each
is, that the handful of squatters is exclusively entitled,
in the exercise of Popular Sovereignty, to pass upon the
question of Slavery in the Territories, and to vote it up
or vote it down, without any intervention from Congress.</p>

<p>If this principle were asserted only with regard to a
single Territory, or even with regard to a single county
or a single town, it ought to be opposed as fallacious
and unjust; but when asserted as a general principle
applicable to all the Territories of the Republic, it
must be resisted, not only as fallacious and unjust,
but as fraught with consequences difficult to measure.
Glance for one moment at the vast spaces which it
would open to this mad conflict, and you will be awed
by the immensity of the question.</p>

<p>According to official documents, the whole territorial
extent of the United States, including States and Territories,
embraces about three million square miles. This
in itself is no inconsiderable portion of the earth’s surface.
It is nearly ten times as large as Great Britain
and France combined,&mdash;three times as large as the whole
of France, Great Britain, Austria, Prussia, Spain, Portugal,
Belgium, Holland, and Denmark together,&mdash;only a
little less than the whole sixty Empires, States, and Republics
of all Europe,&mdash;and of equal extent with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
ancient Roman Empire, or the empire of Alexander,
neither of which is said to have exceeded three million
square miles. Of this vast area, about one half is
now organized into States, leaving one million five hundred
thousand square miles in the condition of outlying
territory, whose future fortunes are involved in the decision
of the present question.</p>

<p>If the subject assumes colossal proportions when we
regard the extent of territory, it swells to yet grander
form when we look at the population involved. The
whole white population of the United States at the
present moment amounts to 27,000,000. Supposing it
to increase at the rate of 34 per cent in ten years, which
may be inferred from the rate at which it has already
increased, it will number in 1870, 36,000,000; in 1880,
48,000,000; in 1890, 64,000,000; in 1900, 85,000,000;
in 1910, 113,000,000; in 1920, 151,000,000; in 1930,
202,000,000; in 1940, 270,000,000; in 1950, 361,000,000;
and in 1960, just one hundred years from now, it
will reach 483,000,000 of white freemen. Here we may
well stop to take breath. Add to this white population
50,000,000 of colored population, whether free
or slave, according to the supposed increase, and we
shall have a sum-total of 533,000,000; and in two hundred
years, with the same continuing rate of increase,
our population will be ten times larger than that of the
whole globe at the present hour.</p>

<p>This extraordinary multitude will not be confined to
the present States. It will diffuse itself in every direction,
covering all our territory as the waters cover the
sea. Precisely how it will be distributed it is impossible
to foreknow. But the tendency of population is
Westward. The Eastern States are becoming stationary.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
Assuming that in 1960 the area now unoccupied
will be settled at the rate of Massachusetts in 1850,
which was 127 to the square mile, we shall then have
on that territory a white population of 190,000,000.
And the simple question is, Whether this enormous territory,
with this enormous population, shall be exposed
to all the accumulating evils of Slavery, with their hateful
legacy, at the mere will of the handful of first settlers?
According to a French proverb, “It is only the
first step which costs,” and there is profound truth in
this saying. In similar spirit the ancient Romans said,
<i>Obsta principiis</i>, “Oppose beginnings.”</p>

<p>Never were these time-honored maxims more applicable
than in the present case, when such prodigious
results are involved. All experience shows that it takes
very little Slavery to constitute a Slave State, and
that Slavery, when once introduced, is most tenacious
of existence. Mr. Lincoln, in one of his speeches, has
aptly likened it to the Canada thistle, which, when
once planted, extends with most injurious pertinacity.
Others liken it to a cancer or vicious disease, which,
when once in the system, corrupts the blood forever.
It may be likened to a superstitious usage, which,
when once established in the customs of a people,
yields reluctantly to every effort against it. And yet
Mr. Thayer wrests from Congress, representing the
whole country, all power to prevent the introduction
of this transcendent evil, and transfers the whole question
to a handful of squatters, who are to act for the
weal or woe of half a continent with teeming millions
of population; and this is done in the name of
Popular Sovereignty, as announced in the Declaration
of Independence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span></p>

<p>Fellow-citizens, I deny this pretension in every respect
and at every point. I assert the power of Congress,
founded on reason and precedent; and I assert
the overwhelming necessity at this moment of exercising
this unquestionable power. Guardians of this
mighty territory, the destined home of untold millions,
we must see that it is securely consecrated to the
uses of Freedom, so that it cannot be pressed by the
footsteps of a slave. For the moment we are performing
the duty of <i>conditores imperiorum</i>, or founders of
States, which Lord Bacon, in sententious wisdom, places
foremost in honor, and calls a “primitive and heroical
work.”<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> In the discharge of this duty, every power,
every effort, every influence for Freedom should be
invoked. The angel at the gates of Paradise, with
flaming sword turning to every side, might be fitly
summoned to guard this grand inheritance.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Not only do I assert this power, but I deny that
sovereignty, when justly understood, has among its
incidents the right to enslave our fellow-man. Mr.
Thayer practically recognizes this incident; for he insists
upon leaving the handful of squatters in the Territories
to vote Slavery up or vote Slavery down without
any intervention from Congress. And here is the
vital question: Is there any such power incident to
sovereignty?</p>

<p>And since the Declaration of Independence is invoked
as authority for this new pretension, I shall bring
it precisely to this touchstone. Bear with me, if I am
tedious.</p>

<p>On the 4th of July, 1776, was put forth that great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
state paper, which constitutes an epoch of history. Its
primary object was to dissolve the bonds which existed
between the Colonies and the mother country. For this
purpose a few positive words would have sufficed. But
its authors were not content with this enunciation. Ascending
far above the simple idea of National Independence,
they made their Declaration an example to
mankind, in two respects: first, as a Declaration of
Human Rights; and, secondly, as an admission that
the Sovereignty which they established was limited by
Right.</p>

<p>In the first place, they declared “that all men are
created equal; that they are endowed by their Creator
with certain unalienable rights; that among these are
life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness”; and “that
to secure these rights, governments are instituted among
men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the
governed.” Note well these words. Here was a Declaration
of Natural Rights, the first ever put forth in
history, unless we except the declaration only a few
months earlier in Virginia. In England there have been
Bills of Rights, beginning with Magna Charta, all declaring
simply the rights of Englishmen, and all founded
on concession and precedent. Now came a Declaration
of the Rights of Man, not founded on concession or
precedent, but founded on Nature. And this Declaration,
though made the basis of the new government, was
universal in application, so that people, wherever struggling
for rights, have been cheered by its words.</p>

<p>There is another enunciation, by which the Declaration
is equally memorable, although this feature has
been less noticed. Certainly it has not been noticed
by Mr. Thayer, or he would never venture to derive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
his pretension from a Declaration which positively excludes
all such idea. Other governments, even those
of the American Colonies, have been founded on <em>force</em>,
and the sovereignty which they claimed was unlimited,
so as to sanction Slavery. That I may not seem
to make this statement hastily, pardon me, if I adduce
two illustrative authorities. I refer first to Sir
William Blackstone, the commentator on the Laws of
England, who says: “There is and must be in all forms
of government, however they began, or by what right
soever they subsist, a supreme, irresistible, absolute, uncontrolled
authority, in which the <em>rights of sovereignty</em>
reside;”<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> and this power, which in England is attributed
to Parliament, he calls in one place “that <em>absolute
despotic power</em> which must in all governments reside
<em>somewhere</em>.”<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> I refer also to the famous Dr. Johnson,
who, in his tract entitled “Taxation no Tyranny,” openly
says that “all government is ultimately and essentially
absolute”; that “in sovereignty there are no gradations”;
that “there must in every society be some
power or other from which there is no appeal,” which
“extends or contracts privileges, exempt itself from
question or control, and bounded only by physical necessity.”<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>

<p>In the face of these contemporary authorities, one
an eminent jurist, and the other an eminent moralist,
both well known to our fathers, and in the face of all
traditions of government, the Declaration of Independence
disclaimed all despotic, absolute, or unlimited
power, and voluntarily brought the new sovereignty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
within the circumscription of <em>Right</em>. Not content with
declaring that the rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit
of happiness are inalienable, and therefore beyond the
control of any sovereignty, the Declaration went further,
and, by abnegation worthy of perpetual honor, solemnly
restrained the new sovereignty,&mdash;simply claiming
for it the “power to do all acts and things which
independent states may <span class="smcap">OF</span> RIGHT do.” Even had
this express limitation been omitted, no such incident
of sovereignty as that asserted by Mr. Thayer could
be derived from an instrument containing those words
with which the Declaration begins; but with these
latter words of special limitation, the pretension becomes
absurd.</p>

<p>Such, fellow-citizens, is the Popular Sovereignty of
the Declaration of Independence, drawing its life, first,
from the inalienable Rights of Man, and then, by positive
words, restrained to what is Right. And this is
the Popular Sovereignty which, lifting the down-trodden
and trampling on tyrants,&mdash;now gentle as Charity,
and then terrible as an army with banners,&mdash;is destined
to make the tour of the world, rendering Slavery everywhere
impossible.</p>

<p>Of this Popular Sovereignty I have spoken on another
occasion,<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> and I refrain with difficulty from repeating
now what I said then, partly because I believe
so completely in its truth and rejoice in its utterance,
but more because I learn that it has been wrested from
its place to cover the Popular Tyranny, misnamed Popular
Sovereignty, which Mr. Thayer so ardently vindicates.</p>

<p>How strange that words which hail the Angel of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
Human Liberation, with Liberty and Equality in her
glorious train, should be invoked in support of a wicked
tyranny, which, in the name of Popular Sovereignty,
makes merchandise of our fellow-man! Face to face
against this wretched pretension I put the true Popular
Sovereignty, with Liberty and Equality for all, guarded
and surrounded by the impassable limitation of Right,
which is the god Terminus, never to be overthrown.
Within these great precincts there can be no Slavery,
nor can there be any denial of Equal Rights. How,
then, can any man, in the name of Popular Sovereignty,
vote another to be a slave? How, then, can any man,
in this name, assert property in his fellow-man? By
what excuse, with what reason, on what argument can
any such thing be done, without first denying all that
is true and sacred? Liberty, which is the active principle
of Popular Sovereignty,&mdash;Equality, which is twin
sister of Liberty,&mdash;and Justice, which sets bounds to
all that men do on earth,&mdash;these are the irresistible
enemies of Slavery, each and all of which must be trampled
out by any rule under which man can be made a
slave. But these, each and all, constitute that Popular
Sovereignty which is the glory of our institutions. Anything
else calling itself by this great name is a mockery
and a sham, fit only for hissing and scorn.</p>

<p>The Declaration of Independence gave dignity to our
Revolutionary contest, and made it a landmark of human
progress. Here, at last, the rights of man were
proclaimed, and a government was organized in subjection
to the sovereign rule of Right. The people, while
lifting themselves to the duties of sovereignty, bowed
before that overruling sovereignty whose seat is the
bosom of God. Such an example became at once a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
guide to mankind. It was copied in France, under the
lead of Lafayette; and there is no people struggling for
Right in either hemisphere who have not felt its inspiration.
And yet this Declaration, standing highest
among the historic landmarks of our country, is now
assailed and dishonored.</p>

<p>It is assailed and dishonored, first, by denial of these
natural rights which it so gloriously declares. This is
done often with a jeer. Forgetful that these rights
were divinely established at the very Creation, when
God said, “Let us make man in our image,” and then
again in the Gospel, when it was said, “God hath
made of one blood all nations of men,”&mdash;forgetful that
these rights are stamped by Nature on all who wear the
human form,&mdash;forgetful also that they belong to those
self-evident truths, sometimes called axioms, which are
universal in their application, as the axiom in arithmetic
that two and two make four, and the axiom in geometry
that a straight line is the shortest distance between two
points,&mdash;forgetful of the true glory of our country, these
primal truths are sometimes scouted as “absurd,” sometimes
as “splendid generalities,” and sometimes as a
“self-evident lie.” This assault, though proceeding from
various voices, originated with Mr. Calhoun. He is its
first author.</p>

<p>And now, secondly, the Declaration is assailed and
dishonored by the claim, that men, in the exercise of
sovereignty derived from the Declaration, may set up on
an auction-block their fellow-men, if to them it seems
fit, and that this power is an incident of Popular Sovereignty.
This pretension, first put forth by General
Cass, in 1847, when a Presidential candidate,<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> and now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
revived by Mr. Douglas, who peddles it throughout the
country, is also practically adopted by Mr. Thayer,
as part of his peculiar Territorial policy. Such a pretension
is hardly less degrading to the Declaration than
the open mockery of its primal truths by Mr. Calhoun.
The latter, as is well known, denied the sovereignty of
the people in the Territories, but he agreed, heart and
soul, in the pretension that the right to enslave a fellow-man
is an incident of sovereignty, wherever it exists.</p>

<p>Thus do these two assaults upon the Declaration
practically proceed from one source. In their essential
ideas they are <em>Calhounism</em>.</p>

<p>On the other side is arrayed a name illustrious for
various public service, and for unsurpassed championship
of Freedom: I mean John Quincy Adams. Entering
the House of Representatives after a long life, at
home and abroad, as Senator, as Minister, as Secretary
of State, and finally as President, he added to all these
titles by the ability and constancy with which he
upheld the Rights of Man. Mr. Calhoun was at this
time in the Senate; but Mr. Adams incessantly met
all his assumptions for Slavery,&mdash;exposing its hateful
character, insisting upon its <em>prohibition</em> in the Territories,
and especially vindicating the Declaration of Independence.
Never has the recent pretension, in the
name of Popular Sovereignty, been more completely anticipated
and exposed. And now, that this argument
may not stand entirely upon my words, I quote from
him. Says John Quincy Adams, in his oration on the
Fourth of July, 1831, at Quincy:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Unlimited power belongs not to the nature of man, and
rotten will be the foundation of every government leaning
upon such a maxim for its support.… The pretence of an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
absolute, irresistible, despotic power existing in every government
<em>somewhere</em> is incompatible with the first principle
of natural right.… The <em>sovereignty</em> which would arrogate
to itself absolute, unlimited power must appeal for its sanction
to those illustrious expounders of Human Rights, Pharaoh
of Egypt and Herod the Great of Judea.”<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>

</div>

<p>In another passage of the same oration, the patriot
statesman says, in words which answer a portion of Mr.
Thayer’s arguments:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“It has sometimes been objected to the Declaration, that
it deals too much in abstractions. But this was its characteristic
excellence; for upon those abstractions hinged the
justice of the cause. Without them our Revolution would
have been but successful rebellion. Right, truth, justice
are all abstractions. The Divinity that stirs within the
soul of man is abstraction. The Creator of the universe is
a spirit, and all spiritual nature is abstraction. Happy
would it be, could we answer with equal confidence another
objection, not to the Declaration, but to the consistency of
the people by whom it was proclaimed!”<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

</div>

<p>These same views were enforced again by Mr. Adams
in his oration at Newburyport, July 4, 1837. There
he uses words which reveal the limits of Popular Sovereignty.
Thus he speaks:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The sovereign authority conferred upon the people of
the Colonies by the Declaration of Independence could not
dispense them, nor any individual citizen of them, from the
fulfilment of all their moral obligations.… The people who
assumed their equal and separate station among the powers
of the earth, by the laws of Nature’s God, by that very act
acknowledged themselves bound to the observance of those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
laws, <em>and could neither exercise nor confer any power inconsistent
with them</em>.”<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Then alluding to the self-imposed restraints upon the
sovereignty which was established, our teacher says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The Declaration acknowledged a rule of <em>Right</em> paramount
to the power of independent states itself, and virtually
disclaimed all power to do <em>Wrong</em>. This was a novelty
in the moral philosophy of nations, and it is the essential
point of difference between the system of government announced
in the Declaration of Independence and those systems
which had until then prevailed among men.… It
was an experiment upon the heart of man. All the legislators
of the human race until that day had laid the foundations
of all government among men in <em>Power</em>; and hence
it was that in the maxims of theory, as well as in the practice
of nations, sovereignty was held to be unlimited and
illimitable. The Declaration of Independence proclaimed
another law, … a law of <em>Right</em>, binding upon nations
as well as individuals, upon sovereigns as well as upon subjects.…
In assuming the attributes of <em>sovereign power</em>,
the Colonists appealed to the Supreme Judge of the world
for the rectitude of their intentions, and neither claimed
nor conferred authority to do anything but <em>of Right</em>.”<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Such is the irresistible testimony of John Quincy
Adams. On the other side are arrayed John C. Calhoun,
Stephen A. Douglas, and Eli Thayer. Choose
you between these two sides.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Enough, perhaps, has been said. But I shall not
leave this question merely on reason and high authority,
decisive as they may be. I appeal, further, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
the practice of the National Government, which from
the beginning has sanctioned the Prohibition of Slavery
in the Territories. The pretension of Popular Sovereignty
is altogether a modern invention, unknown to
our fathers.</p>

<p>The positive Prohibition of Slavery in the Territories
was proposed in the Continental Congress by Mr. Jefferson,
as early as 1784. Thus did the hand which
drew the Declaration of Independence first assert the
practical application of its principles within the jurisdiction
of Congress; and here the Popular Sovereignty
of the Declaration receives most instructive illustration.
Although the proposition had in its favor a
majority of all the delegates then present, and also a
majority of all the States then present, yet, under the
rules of the Continental Congress, it failed for the moment.
But there is no evidence that anybody questioned
the power of Congress, or claimed Sovereignty
for any handful of squatters.</p>

<p>The following year, in the absence of Mr. Jefferson,
the Prohibition was proposed by Rufus King, a delegate
from Massachusetts. It was afterwards embodied by
Nathan Dane, another delegate from Massachusetts, in
the Ordinance for the Government of the Northwest
Territory; and finally, on the 13th of July, 1787, a day
ever memorable in the annals of Human Freedom, it
was carried with only one vote in the negative, and became
the corner-stone of those imperial States destined
to exercise such controlling influence in our history.
Thus early did our Commonwealth, through its faithful
Representatives, insist upon Prohibition by Congress.
This was before the National Constitution.</p>

<p>The Ordinance thus adopted by the Continental Congress<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
was affirmed in August, 1789, by the first Congress
that sat under the Constitution, in a law which bears
the signature of George Washington. In pursuance of
its provisions, Ohio was admitted into the Union, 19th
February, 1803; Indiana, 11th December, 1816; Illinois,
3d December, 1818; Michigan, 26th January, 1837;
and Wisconsin, 29th May, 1848. In the various Acts of
Congress preparatory to the admission of these States,
the validity of the Ordinance was recognized to the
fullest extent. Meanwhile the same principle was applied
in the Missouri Compromise, under which Slavery
was prohibited by Congress in all the territory west
of the Mississippi and north of 36° 30´; also in the
organization of Iowa as a Territory, 12th June, 1838,
and especially of Oregon as a Territory, 14th August,
1848. Thus from the beginning has this power been
affirmed by successive Congresses and by successive
Presidents, from George Washington to James K. Polk.
It is impossible to present any principle in our history
sustained by a line of precedents so imposing.</p>

<p>The necessity of this Prohibition, as a safeguard to
the Territories, is apparent from well-attested occurrences.
The people of the Territory of Indiana, embracing
the larger part of the whole of the Northwestern
Territory, in 1802, then again in 1805, then
again in 1807, and at other times also, with the pertinacity
which marks all struggles for Slavery, petitioned
Congress to suspend the Prohibition, so as to allow the
introduction of slaves, if the squatters should desire it.
To the honor of Congress, their petitions were rejected;
but they are memorable from a brief report adverse to
their passage by John Randolph, of Virginia. Here it
is, bearing date 2d March, 1803.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“That the rapid population of the State of Ohio sufficiently
evinces, in the opinion of your Committee, that the
labor of slaves is not necessary to promote the growth and
settlement of colonies in that region. That this labor, demonstrably
the dearest of any, can only be employed to advantage
in the cultivation of products more valuable than
any known to that quarter of the United States. That the
Committee deem it <em>highly dangerous and inexpedient to impair
a provision wisely calculated to promote the happiness
and prosperity of the Northwestern country</em>, and to give
strength and security to that extensive frontier. <em>In the
salutary operation of this sagacious and benevolent restraint</em>
it is believed that the inhabitants of Indiana will at no
very distant day find ample remuneration for a temporary
privation of labor and of emigration.”<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>

</div>

<p>With these benignant and most suggestive words of
an eminent Slave-Master Congress happily concurred,
and the Prohibition was confirmed. Had the modern
pretension of Popular Sovereignty then prevailed, the
States of Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, and Wisconsin,
instead of becoming the smiling home of Free Labor,
would be suffering from the blight of Slavery,&mdash;instead
of joining in triumphant vote for Lincoln, they would,
like their neighbor, Missouri, be linked with the Slave
States in support of Breckinridge, or Bell, or Douglas,
and would constitute part of that Slave Power under
whose tyranny the country has so long suffered.</p>

<p>The advantage of the Prohibition is as clear as its
necessity. I do not dwell on the comparison between
Free States and Slave States, between free labor and
slave labor, between the social system fostered by Freedom
and the social system engendered by Slavery, between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
the civilization of the one and the barbarism of
the other; but I call attention simply to two States,
covering nearly the same spaces of latitude, resembling
each other in soil, climate, and natural productions, lying
side by side, and organized at about the same time,&mdash;Illinois,
thanks to the Prohibition, a Free State, and
Missouri cursed with more than one hundred thousand
slaves. Look at the statistics of these two States, if
you would know the contrast which day by day magnifies
the Prohibition.</p>

<p>And yet, in the face of all this experience, showing,
first, the necessity of Prohibition as a safeguard to the
Territories, and, secondly, its immeasurable advantages,
you are now called to abandon the early policy of the
Republic, to turn your back upon this policy as irrational
and unwise, and to adopt a new pretension, with
a plausible name, which, in the only instance where
it has been tried, produced discord, strife, and blood.
You are called to give up the old Aladdin’s Lamp of
magical power, filling the land with infinite treasures
and the true nobility of Freedom, and to take in exchange
a new patent article now hawked about the
streets of Worcester.</p>

<p>If this recent pretension, in the name of Popular Sovereignty,
were merely an idea and nothing more, coined
in the brain of an ingenious theorist, but not pressed
persistently at all times into practical application, it
might be left with kindred errors to pass away quietly
into the limbo of things lost on earth, as described by
Milton:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse indent9">“then reliques, beads,</div>
<div class="verse">Indulgences, dispenses, pardons, bulls,</div>
<div class="verse">The sport of winds.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">But unhappily this is not the case.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span></p>

<p>Such a pretension, espoused with ardor, as a practical
rule, must naturally exercise a disturbing influence.
You have not forgotten its influence on General
Cass, who, yielding to it, violated the instructions
of his State and voted against the Prohibition. You all
know its influence on Mr. Douglas. In the name of
this pretension he overturned the time-honored Prohibition
of Slavery in the Missouri Territory, and delivered
over Kansas to a conflict where fraud, rapine,
and murder stalked with impunity. Afterward, in the
name of this pretension, he sought to arrest all action
by Congress for the relief of the settlers there. And
ever since he has made this pretension a plain “dodge,”
in order to avoid the urgent question: Are you for Freedom,
or are you for Slavery? on which every citizen
ought to say plainly, “Yea” or “Nay.”</p>

<p>It has not been the lot of your Representative to play
a part so conspicuous as that of Mr. Douglas. But
this pretension has changed his course hardly less than
it has varied the course of the Presidential candidate,
driving him into acts which only his large ingenuity
in “making the worse appear the better reason” can
save from an outburst of universal and indignant condemnation.
And now, as I touch briefly on these acts,
let me say that I do it most reluctantly, most painfully,
and only in obedience to the absolute exigencies of this
discussion, that you may truly understand the character
of the pretension on which you are to pass judgment at
the polls.</p>

<p>Surely its <em>disturbing influence</em> is manifest in his vote
on the Bill to annul the Slave Code of New Mexico,
under which not only slavery of blacks, but also serfdom
of whites is recognized, while laborers of all kinds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
are subjected to be cuffed, flogged, beaten, or otherwise
punished by their employers, without any redress at
law. The blood freezes at the idea of such a code extant
in a Territory within the jurisdiction of Congress.
And yet, on the ayes and noes upon declaring this code
null and void, Mr. Thayer’s name is recorded “no,”
with the ninety Proslavery Democrats and Americans,
against ninety-seven Republicans; and thus you, fellow-citizens
of Worcester, whose Representative he then
was, have been made parties to an odious crime. I
use plain language; for only in this way can that atrocious
code be characterized, which in itself is the paragon
and <i>ne plus ultra</i> of cold-blooded, scientific, and
most cruel tyranny.</p>

<p>Surely its <em>disturbing influence</em> is again manifest in
his vote on the Bill to abolish Polygamy in the vast
Territory of Utah, where Brigham Young with his forty
wives repeats the scandal of a Turkish harem within
the jurisdiction of Congress. On the ayes and noes,
Mr. Thayer’s name is found in the small minority of
sixty noes, composed of <em>ultraists</em> of Proslavery, against
one hundred and forty-nine ayes; and you, fellow-citizens
of Worcester, whose Representative he then
was, have been made parties to the sanction of Polygamy.
It is natural that the partisans of Slavery,
which nullifies the relation of husband and wife, should
be indifferent to this disgusting offence; but nothing
short of a most potent disturbing influence could have
brought your Representative to a similar indifference.</p>

<p>Surely its <em>disturbing influence</em> is again manifest in
his course on the Territorial Bills reported by Mr.
Grow from the Committee on Territories, for the organization
of the five Territories of Idaho, Nevada, Arizona,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
Dakota, and Chippewa, all of which were tabled
by the vote of Mr. Thayer, and all but one on his motion.
Afterward, in debate, he boasted that he “had
taken the lead in this business of killing off these Territorial
organizations, which go upon the assumption
that the people in a Territory are infants,”<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> thus setting
up this disturbing pretension as his apology, and claiming
for squatters a tyrannical power.</p>

<p>Surely its <em>disturbing influence</em> is again manifest in
his perversion of unquestionable facts of history with
regard to the operation of the Ordinance for the Government
of the Northwestern Territory, saying that
Freedom was secured in that Territory through Popular
Sovereignty and not through the Ordinance; whereas
history shows, by unimpeachable evidence, that this
great work was accomplished through the Ordinance.
Read the able speech of the Republican candidate, Mr.
Bailey, if you would appreciate the extent of this perversion.</p>

<p>Surely its <em>disturbing influence</em> is again manifest in
the language by which he allows himself to disparage
that great cause, so dear to the people of Worcester,
which first brought him into public life: saying that
the principle of Prohibition, introduced by Jefferson, approved
by the Fathers, and now amply vindicated by
its fruits, is a “humbug”; and then again saying, “I
think the Slave Question is altogether too small a question
to disturb so great a people as inhabit the United
States of America”: thus confessing insensibility to
the grandeur of that question now overshadowing all
other questions, which it is the first duty of a statesman
in our country to understand and to appreciate.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span></p>
<p>Surely its <em>disturbing influence</em> is again manifest in
the tone and manner which he has adopted toward the
Antislavery cause, and its supporters in Congress, as
will be seen by all who read his speeches there. Let
the good people of this district know these things, and
say if they are ready to join in such contumely.</p>

<p>And, lastly, the <em>disturbing influence</em> is manifest in his
setting himself up as an independent candidate for Congress,
against the Republican party, whose Presidential
candidate he professes to support.</p>

<p>It will be for you to determine, whether a candidate,
under this <em>disturbing influence</em>, thus repeatedly manifest
in signal acts, can adequately represent the active,
conscientious, Freedom-loving citizens of Worcester,
who oppose Slavery by something more practical than a
theory. I do not doubt his integrity; nor do I utter
one word against his personal character. I speak of
him only as a public man, open to criticism for public
acts; and I speak solemnly and sincerely, for the sake
of the cause which I have at heart. Honest men with
a false theory are sometimes as dangerous as bad men.
I would not liken Mr. Thayer to Benedict Arnold; but
there is a letter of the latter, immediately after his defection,
addressed to Washington, which your Representative
might adopt. Here it is.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="right medium">“<span class="smcap">On Board the Vulture</span>,<br />
25 September, 1780.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;The heart which is conscious of its own rectitude
cannot attempt to palliate a step which the world may censure
as wrong. I have ever acted from a principle of love to
my country, since the commencement of the present unhappy
contest between Great Britain and the Colonies. The
same principle of love to my country actuates my present
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>conduct, however it may appear inconsistent to the world,
who very seldom judge right of any man’s actions.”<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The difference between the two cases is obvious. One
is flat treason: the other is flat delusion. One is a
crime which history can never pardon: the other is a
mistake over which history will drop a tear.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Fellow-Republicans, you are about to choose Abraham
Lincoln President. Of his election there is no
reasonable doubt. Under his auspices the National
Government will be brought back to the original policy
of the Fathers, which placed Slavery, so far at least as
it is outside the States, within the jurisdiction of Congress.
It was for his fidelity to this principle, vindicating
it against the pretension of Popular Sovereignty,
in his long debate with Mr. Douglas, and openly declaring,
that, “if he were in Congress, and a vote should
come up on a question whether Slavery should be prohibited
in a new Territory, he would vote that it should,
in spite of the Dred Scott decision,”<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a>&mdash;on this account
it was that Mr. Lincoln was eligible as the Republican
candidate. But it is not enough to make him
President. You must see that he is sustained in this
fundamental principle by your Representative in Congress.
And since his election is now beyond question,
the vote for a Representative true to this principle becomes
more important than a vote for him. Little
good will you do in voting for him, if at the same time
you vote for a Representative pledged to defeat his declared
policy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span></p>

<p>Vote, then, so as to vindicate the declared policy of
your candidate for the Presidency.</p>

<p>Vote so as to vindicate the Declaration of Independence,
which is dishonored by being made the authority
for a false pretension in the name of Popular Sovereignty.</p>

<p>Vote so as to vindicate the early policy of the Fathers,
who organized the Prohibition of Slavery in the
Territories.</p>

<p>Vote so as to vindicate the early policy of Massachusetts,
who, in the Continental Congress, immediately
after the Revolution, first by the voice of Rufus King,
and then by the voice of Nathan Dane, insisted upon
the Prohibition of Slavery in the Territories.</p>

<p>Vote so as to vindicate those sentiments and principles
of the County of Worcester, “heart of the Commonwealth,”
always so constantly and honorably maintained.</p>

<p>Vote so as to vindicate the Antislavery cause in its
necessity, practicability, and dignity, and so as to confound
its enemies, now banding together against it,
under the lead of Mr. Thayer.</p>

<p>Vote so as to vindicate the existence of the Republican
party, which, if the theory of Mr. Thayer be true,
should at once be disbanded.</p>

<p>Vote, finally, so as to settle peacefully this great question,
by taking it away from the chance and peril of
conflict, and committing it to the calm judgment of
Congress.</p>

<p>It is vain to say that Slavery cannot exist in the
Territories under the Constitution, and therefore legislation
is superfluous. It is there in fact, and that is
enough. It must be struck at once by Congress. St.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
Patrick banished snakes from Ireland; but that is no
reason why the woman should not bruise the head of
one found there. It is vain to say, as has been said,
that the slaves are few,&mdash;amounting to fourteen only
in New Mexico; for human rights, whether in a vast
multitude or a solitary individual, are entitled to equal
and unhesitating support. In this spirit the ancient
lawgiver nobly declared that to be the best government
“where an injury to a single citizen is resented
as an injury to the whole state.” It is vain to say that
the prohibition by Congress is superfluous in the present
state of opinion; for nothing is clearer than the
remark of Lafayette, that principles strong in themselves
take new force, when solemnly recognized by
all in the form of law. It is vain to say that Freedom
is more powerful than Slavery, and therefore may be
safely left face to face with its antagonist. In the progress
of civilization, law has superseded the ordeal by
battle; and law must now supersede this conflict. It
is vain to say that the Territories are protected in any
form, whether by the Constitution, public opinion, or
the inherent strength of Freedom. No possible safeguard
should be abandoned. Let there be double locks,
double bolts, and double gates. No lock, no bolt, and
no gate should be neglected by which Slavery may be
fastened out. And, lastly, if Popular Sovereignty is
invoked, let it be the Popular Sovereignty of the American
people, counted by millions and assembled in Congress,
rather than the tyrannical, irresponsible sovereignty
of a handful of squatters.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Fellow-citizens, in taking leave of this question, I
bear my testimony again to the abilities of Mr. Thayer,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
and to his active labors in times past. For the good
that he has done I honor him; let it all be enrolled
for his benefit. But not on this account can I accept
him now as a representative of our cause. It is an ancient
story, consecrated by the undying verse of Homer,
that a ship, with all its canvas spread, was suddenly
changed into a rock at the very mouth of a frequented
harbor; and thus the instrument of commerce
became an impediment to commerce:&mdash;</p>

<p class="noindent">A similar wonder is now repeated before our eyes,
making the former instrument of Freedom an impediment
to Freedom. Deplore this accident we must; but
the remedy is happily within our power.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/line.png" width="80" height="16" alt="" />
</div>

<div class="medium">

<p>This meeting was called to order by Carlos Pierce, Esq., who announced
the officers of the evening, among whom was Mr. Sumner
as President. On taking the chair, he made a speech, which is preserved
here as showing the anticipations of triumph at the election,
and also the declared magnitude of the result. This testimony shows
how seriously the election was regarded. It foreshadows change, if not
revolution,&mdash;“not only a new President, but a new government.”</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">FELLOW-CITIZENS,&mdash;Five years have now passed
since it was my privilege last to set foot in Faneuil
Hall. During this long, unwilling exile, whether
at home or abroad, my “heart untravelled” has fondly
turned to this historic place, and often have I seemed
to hear those utterances for Human Rights which
echo along its walls. The distant in place was confounded
with the distant in time, and the accents of
our own Burlingame seemed to mingle with the words
of Adams, Hancock, and Warren, in the past. Let me
express my gratitude that I am permitted once more to
enjoy these generous utterances, no longer in dream or
vision only, but in reality.</p>

<p>Could these venerable arches speak, what stories
could they not tell,&mdash;sometimes of victory and sometimes
of defeat, sometimes of gladness and sometimes
of mourning, sometimes of hope and sometimes of
fear! The history of American Freedom, with all its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
anxieties, struggles, and triumphs, commencing before
National Independence, and continued down to the
very contest now about to close,&mdash;all this might be
written from the voices of this Hall. But, thank God!
the days of defeat, of mourning, of fear, have passed,
and these walls will record only those notes of victory
already beginning to sound in our ears.</p>

<p>There are anniversaries in our history noticed by
young and old with grateful emotion; but to-morrow’s
sun will set on a day more glorious for Freedom than
any anniversary since the fourth of July, 1776. The
forces for a long time mustering are about to meet face
to face; but the result is not doubtful. That Power,
which, according to the boast of Slave-Masters, has
governed the country for more than fifty years,&mdash;organizing
cabinets and courts, directing the army and
navy, controlling legislation, usurping offices, stamping
its own pernicious character upon the national policy,
and especially claiming all the Territories for Slavery,&mdash;that
Power which has taught us by example how
much of tyranny there may be in the name of Democracy,
is doomed. The great clock will soon strike, sounding
its knell. Every four years a new President is chosen,
but rarely a new government. To-morrow we shall
have not only a new President, but a new government.
A new order of things will begin, and our history will
proceed on a grander scale, in harmony with those sublime
principles in which it commenced. Let the knell
sound!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span></p>

<p>The eve of election is not the time for argument.
Already this has been amply done in numerous public
meetings, where you have been addressed by the
orators of Freedom, and also in the press, which has
repeated their eloquent words, while a new power, in
happy harmony with the new exigencies&mdash;the “Wide-Awakes”&mdash;has
shown how true it is that citizens by
the million would spring forth, whenever the North</p>

<div class="verse">“Stamped her strong foot and said she would be free.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>I need not speak of our candidate for President,
whose simple, honest character has grown constantly
upon the public interest, while his abilities have everywhere
commanded most unhesitating respect. Nor
need I speak of our candidate for Governor, whose
eminent qualities alike of head and heart give assurance
of a man deserving our most devoted support. Of
their election there is no doubt. Abraham Lincoln will
be President of the United States. John A. Andrew
will be Governor of Massachusetts.</p>

<p>But this is not enough. Especially must you see to
it, so far as depends on you, that Representatives in
Congress are chosen who shall be true to the principles
of the Republican party. And since the election of our
President is now certain, your vote for Representatives
becomes more important than your vote for President.
In vain you will vote for Abraham Lincoln, if at the
same time you vote for a Representative who will oppose
his well-known principles. Such a vote will more
than neutralize your vote for President.</p>

<p>Happily there is no occasion to hesitate. Boston is
now represented in Congress by two eminent citizens,&mdash;differing
from each other in many respects, unlike
in the talents which each so largely possesses, and dissimilar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
in character, and yet substantially agreeing
in principles, uniting always in their votes, whether to
guard Freedom or to promote the important interests
of the metropolis, and by their very diversity of character,
as the complement of each other, representing
completely and harmoniously a large and diversified
constituency. Follow the record of Mr. Burlingame
and Mr. Rice, whether throughout the long contest for
Speaker, or on the proposition to secure Freedom in
Kansas, or on the various matters of local concern, and
you will find that they always keep together.</p>

<p>Besides the merit of services which no candid person
can question, they are also recommended by the practical
consideration of their experience. They know their
business, and on this account, if no other, it is for your
interest that they should be continued. This experience
is something which belongs to you, if you are wise
enough to use it. On grounds of self-interest the most
simple and obvious, you should vote for them.</p>

<p>But, besides experience, they will have another advantage,
which you will surely not fling away. Being
in harmony with the Administration, they will naturally
have the ear of the President and of his Cabinet;
and this alone will give them opportunities to promote
the interest of Boston such as no Representative
of the Opposition could hope to enjoy.</p>

<p>All will see how impossible it will be for Mr. Appleton
and Mr. Bigelow to represent adequately this great
metropolis during the coming administration. Imagine
them at Washington, with the whole delegation from
New England, ay, almost of the whole North, against
them. Robinson Crusoe and Friday were not more solitary
than these Proslavery Representatives would be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
among their colleagues from the Free States. And when,
on the vote for Speaker, involving the organization of
the House and the arrangement of the public business,
the forces of Slavery are rallied against the Northern
candidate, John Sherman or William Pennington,
then will the Liberty-loving citizens of Boston be mortified
to find their Representatives, under specious plea
of danger to the Union, ranging with Disunionists. A
simple errand-boy, picked up in the streets, honest and
intelligent enough to deposit a vote for a Northern
Speaker, would be better than Representatives who
would do this thing.</p>

<p>The election of such persons would be a positive encouragement
to the disunionists of the South. It would
be a signal of sympathy from our citadel. Still further,
it would be a premium for indifference to fellow-men
struggling for their rights. In vain have we read the
story of him who, having fallen among thieves, was
succored by the good Samaritan, if we approve by our
votes the conduct of those who, when Kansas had fallen
among thieves and was lying wounded and bleeding,
passed by on the other side without aid or sympathy.</p>

<p>In vain you say that these gentlemen, if elected, may
mingle socially with the propagandists of Slavery at
Washington, and through this intercourse promote your
interests. Do not believe it. No good to you can
come from any such artificial fellowship. The enmity
of Slavery may be dangerous, but its friendship is
fatal. None have ever escaped with honor from that
deadly embrace.</p>

<p>In vain you appeal in the name of a party, familiarly
called from its candidates Bell-Everett, which,
in the recent elections of Vermont, Maine, Pennsylvania,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
Ohio, and Indiana, out of more than 1,300,000 votes,
polled less than 20,000,&mdash;a party which, from its lofty
airs here in Boston, may remind us of Brahmins, who
imagine themselves of better clay than others, or of
Chinese, who imagine themselves cousins of the Sun
and Moon.</p>

<p>Vote, then, for your present Representatives: first, to
maintain the policy of the new President; secondly, as
proper recognition of their merits; thirdly, that you
may have the benefit of their experience; fourthly,
that you may have the advantage of their friendly relations
with the new Administration; fifthly, that you
may help choose a Northern Speaker; sixthly, that you
may answer with proper scorn the menaces of disunion,
whether uttered at the South or echoed at the North.</p>

<p>Hereafter, fellow-citizens, let it be one of your satisfactions,
that in this contest you voted for Freedom.
The young man should rejoice in the privilege; the old

<p class="plabeln"><span class="smcap">Speech to the Wide-Awakes of Concord, Massachusetts,
November 7, 1860.</span></p>

<div class="figcenter">

</div>

<div class="medium">

<p>The “Wide-Awakes” constituted a new and powerful agency in
the machinery of American politics. They were companies of active
voters in uniform of cap and cape with a lamp on a staff, organized and
drilled with officers, who by display in the streets increased their
numbers and intensified the prevailing enthusiasm. The organization
was general throughout the Northern States, and constituted the
working element of the Republican party. It has been sometimes
remarked that its military discipline was an unconscious preparation
for the sterner duties at hand.</p>

<p>The companies were not disbanded immediately after the election,
and at several places where Mr. Sumner lectured he received from them
the compliment of a visit after the lecture. This was the case at Concord
on the evening succeeding the Presidential election, when the
Wide-Awakes of the town appeared before the house of Ralph Waldo
Emerson, the admired author, where Mr. Sumner was staying, and their
Captain, Hon. John S. Keyes, made the following address.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Honored Sir</span>,&mdash;In behalf of the Republican Wide-Awakes of Concord,
and of numerous other Republicans, part of that gallant army whose victory
was yesterday achieved, I have the honor to tender to you our respectful
greeting on this occasion of your first visit, after many years of pain and suffering
endured in the cause of Republicanism, to the old battle-ground of
Concord. We could not permit it to pass without at least offering to you a
warm and earnest welcome, especially on the day following that glorious
victory whose brightness no cloud obscures, and whose lustre is owing
more, perhaps, to your earnest efforts in the cause of Freedom than to any
other man. Permit me, Sir, in the name of these Wide-Awakes, to say to
you that we trust with renewed health upon this soil you may bear forward
the glorious cause of Freedom upon which our country has just
entered.”</p>

</div>

<p>Mr. Sumner, standing on the steps of the house, replied as follows.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span></p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Captain and Wide-Awakes</span>:&mdash;</p>

<p class="dropcap">You take me by surprise, absolutely. I am here
to-night in the performance of an agreeable service
outside of politics, and have not anticipated any
such contingency as this with which you honor me,
nor any such welcome.</p>

<p>I thank you, Gentlemen, for the kind and good words
which have fallen from your Captain. They are a
reward for the little I have been able to do in the past,
and will be an encouragement in the future.</p>

<p>I join with you in gladness at the victory we celebrate
to-day,&mdash;not of the cartridge-box, but of the ballot-box.
No victories of the cartridge-box have involved
higher principles or more important results than
that just won by the ballot-box. A poet, whose home
is in Concord, has said that the shot fired here was
heard round the world. I doubt not that our victory
just achieved will awaken reverberations also to
be heard round the world. All men struggling for
rights, vindicating liberal ideas, seeking human improvement,
maintaining republican government, will be
encouraged, when they hear of yesterday. It will be
good news to Garibaldi in Italy, good news to the
French now subjected to imperial power, good news to
English Reformers,&mdash;and so also will it be good news
to all among us who love Liberty, for it proclaims that
at last Liberty has prevailed. Every four years we
choose a new President; but it rarely happens that
we choose a new government, as was done yesterday.
A new order of things is inaugurated, with new auspices,
lifting the Republic once more to that platform
of principles on which it was originally placed by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
Fathers. What victory of the cartridge-box ever did
so much?</p>

<p>Looking at the vote in its practical significance, several
things may be considered as established and proclaimed
by the American people, so that hereafter they
shall not be drawn in question.</p>

<p>Of these I place foremost the irrevocable decree, according
to the very words of Madison, that it is “wrong
to admit in the Constitution the idea that there can be
property in men,”<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a>&mdash;that, therefore, Slavery, if it exists
anywhere, is sectional, and must derive such life as
it has from local law, and not from the Constitution,&mdash;in
opposition to the pretension so often put forward
in its name, that Slavery is national and Freedom sectional.</p>

<p>Then again the American people have declared, that
all outlying Territories, so immense in extent, and destined
to the support of unknown millions, shall be consecrated
to Freedom, so that the vast outstretched soil
shall never know the footprint of a slave: all of which
is the natural conclusion and corollary from the first
decree.</p>

<p>And yet again it is declared, that in the administration
of the National Government the original policy of
the Fathers shall be adopted, in opposition to the policy
of Slavery, which for the last twelve years has been so
tyrannical, and for the last forty years has made its barbaric
impress on the country.</p>

<p>And still further, the decree goes forth that the Slave-Trade
shall be suppressed in reality as in name, that the
statutes against it shall be vigorously enforced, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
power of the Government directed in good faith against
it, all efforts to the contrary notwithstanding.</p>

<p>These things were yesterday proclaimed by the American
people solemnly, and in a way from which there is
no appeal. It was done by a vote destined to be ever
memorable and a landmark of history.</p>

<p>Having obtained this great victory, let us study to
use it with moderation, with prudence, with wisdom.
Through no failure on our part must its proper fruits be
lost. Happily, Abraham Lincoln [<i>prolonged cheers</i>] has
those elements of character needed to carry us through
the crisis. He is calm, prudent, wise, and also brave.
And permit me to say, that there are moments in government
when bravery is not less important than prudence.
He will not see our cause sacrificed through
menaces of disunion from the South, even if echoed in
Massachusetts; and in this firmness he will be sustained
by the American people, insisting upon all that is promised
and secured by the Constitution, and to all menaces,
from whatever quarter, answering back, that the
Union shall be preserved and made more precious by
consecration to Human Rights. [<i>Three cheers for the
Union.</i>]</p>

<p>I thank you for this welcome, and now bid you good
night.</p>

<p class="plabeln"><span class="smcap">Letter to the Wide-Awakes of Boston, at their Festival,
after Election, November 9, 1860.</span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/line.png" width="80" height="16" alt="" />
</div>

<div class="medium">

<p>The defeat of Mr. Burlingame, as a Representative of Boston, which
was keenly felt by Republicans, and especially by Mr. Sumner, opened
the way to his wider career as Minister of the United States to China,
and then as Minister of the Chinese Empire to the Western Powers.
The vote stood 8,014 for Hon. William Appleton, and 7,757 for Mr.
Burlingame.</p>

</div>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="right medium"><span class="smcap">Boston</span>, November 9, 1860.</p>

<p class="dropcap">DEAR SIR,&mdash;An engagement out of the State will
prevent me from uniting with the gallant Wide-Awakes
this evening in their festival at Music Hall.
But my heart will be with them in their joy and in
their sorrow.</p>

<p>They will naturally rejoice in that great victory by
which the American people have solemnly declared
that <em>Slavery is sectional and Freedom is national</em>, so that,
wherever Slavery exists, if it exist at all, it must be
by virtue of local law, and not by virtue of the National
Constitution.</p>

<p>But even this victory, opening a new epoch in our
national history, cannot make us forget the backsliders
of Boston, through whose desertion of principles the
delegation in Congress, pledged to Freedom, has been
weakened, and a blow struck at an eminent Representative
which has fallen upon the hearts of Republicans<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
everywhere throughout the country. To the honor of
Mr. Burlingame, all good Republicans feel wounded
through him; and it is also to his honor that he was
made the mark of special assault.</p>

<p>All experience shows that the partisans of Slavery
stick at nothing, where the imagined interests of Slavery
are in question. The essential brutality of Slavery
showed itself lately in New York, when Marshal Rynders
personally assaulted a venerable citizen who appeared
at his office on public business, cursing him
with most blasphemous oaths; and it showed itself here
in Boston, when the supporters of Mr. Appleton for
weeks traduced the Republican candidate, uttering calumnies
which were as basely false with regard to him
as if they had been uttered in detraction of Mr. Appleton.
Such conduct must make us hate Slavery more,
and add to our mortification that it prevailed among
us.</p>

<p>It belongs to the Republican party, at last triumphant
in the nation, inflexibly to sustain its principles,
and also to sustain the men who are true to these principles.
In this duty I doubt not it will be guided by
that temperate judgment which is in harmony with the
consciousness of right.</p>

<p>God bless the Wide-Awakes! And believe me, dear
Sir,</p>

<p class="sig">Faithfully yours,</p>

<p class="plabeln"><span class="smcap">Speech to the Wide-Awakes, at Providence, Rhode Island,
November 16, 1860.</span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/line.png" width="80" height="16" alt="" />
</div>

<div class="medium">

<p>Late in the evening, after lecturing<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> in Providence, Mr. Sumner,
who was the guest of Hon. A. C. Barstow, received a serenade from the
Wide-Awakes, commanded by Colonel Dexter, with a band of music,
and accompanied by the “Central Glee Club” and the “National
Vocalists.” The space in front of the house, and the streets, for some
distance, were thronged. After music by the band, Mr. Sumner appeared
on the front steps of the house, and addressed the immense
crowd.</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Gentlemen of the Wide-Awakes</span>:&mdash;</p>

<p class="dropcap">I had supposed that with our great triumph you
would naturally retire to your homes, like soldiers
when peace has come. But this goodly show assures
me that here in Providence you still exist as a distinct
body, ready with sympathy, and I doubt not for duty
also.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span></p>
<p>In the faithful record of recent events, the service
performed by the Wide-Awakes cannot be forgotten.
I see it in two different aspects. Besides contributing
immensely to that victory which now gladdens our
hearts, you have shown that here at the North are
men ready, if the exigency requires, to leap forward
in defence of Northern rights, which are only Constitutional
rights. In these two things you have done
well, and I am happy in this opportunity of offering
you my grateful thanks.</p>

<p>All our hearts, fellow-citizens, are swelling with joy
at the Presidential election. It is in congratulation
that you appear to-night once more with banners and
lights, and I rejoice with you,&mdash;as I love Liberty and
love my country. It is impossible to exaggerate the
result. Had we merely elected new officers, that would
have been much; but we have done more. A new
policy is declared. Thus far the National Government
has been inspired by Slavery. It has seemed to exist
for Slavery only. All is now changed. Liberty will be
its inspiration. And what a change! Liberty instead
of Slavery! But you know well that this change, so
beneficent and natural, is in completest harmony with
the Constitution and with the declared sentiments of
our fathers.</p>

<p>I can never banish from my mind that picture of
Washington taking his first oath to support the Constitution
of the United States, when nowhere on the
land within the national jurisdiction breathed a single
slave. At that time Freedom was national. Surely
good men will rejoice to see our country regain once
more that happy condition, nor can any person regret
it who does not deliberately exalt Slavery above Freedom.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
But this condition is secured by the recent election.
Already the country seems fairer, the skies
clearer, the air purer, and all good influences more abundant,
while Liberty opens the way to prosperity and
renown. Not merely will Slavery cease its baleful
predominance in the Government, but other things will
be accomplished. There will be improvements in rivers
and harbors, communications between the Atlantic and
Pacific, homesteads for actual settlers on our public
lands, peace and dignity in our foreign relations, with
sympathy for struggling Liberty everywhere, also economy
in administration, and reform generally,&mdash;all of
which will naturally ensue, when the Republic is once
more inspired by those sentiments in which it had its
being.</p>

<p>While indulging in proper congratulations on such
a victory, we can afford to disregard all menaces, from
whatever quarter they come, whether from the distant
South or nearer home. Conscious of right, we have
only to go forward, mindful always of the Constitution,
mindful also of that just moderation which adds to the
strength of firmness. An ancient poet teaches, that,
“where Prudence is, no Divinity is absent.”<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> I cannot
doubt that the Republican party, to which we belong,
will be as prudent in government as it has been irresistible
at the ballot-box. Such, at least, is my sincere
aspiration.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Fellow-citizens and Wide-Awakes, I thank you for
this unexpected visit, and now most sincerely and
gratefully wish you good night.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span></p>

PRINCIPLES.</h2>

<p class="plabeln"><span class="smcap">Speech to the Wide-Awakes of Lowell, November 21, 1860.</span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/line.png" width="80" height="16" alt="" />
</div>

<div class="medium">

<p>In the evening after his lecture at Lowell, Mr. Sumner was escorted
by the Wide-Awakes, with banners and lights, to the house of Hon.
John Nesmith, whose guest he was. On arrival there, he thanked his
escort in these words:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Wide-Awakes and Fellow-Citizens</span>:&mdash;</p>

<p class="dropcap">I owe my best thanks for the escort with which
you honor me. But I must say frankly that I
attribute it less to any merit of my own than to your
zeal for the good cause in which I have borne a
part.</p>

<p>In our recent triumph the Wide-Awakes have rendered
conspicuous service. The light which they have
carried, I trust, is symbolical of that which, under the
new Administration, will be directed upon the dark
places of Government, while their activity and promptitude
furnish an example which all may be proud to
follow.</p>

<p>The Republican party has prevailed. Its success is
the triumph not only of Freedom, but also of the Constitution,
long perverted to the purposes of Slavery.
Nothing is clearer than this. The Republican party is
not <em>aggressive</em>, but <em>conservative</em>. Its object is to carry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
the Government back to the original policy of the Fathers.
Pardon me, but I never tire of reminding my
fellow-citizens, that, when Washington took his first
oath as President, the Constitution nowhere on the
land, within the national jurisdiction, covered a slave;
and surely the Republican party cannot err, if it seeks
to bring back the condition of things under Washington.
Bear this in mind, if you please; and when it is said
that you are aggressive, reply fearlessly, “Then is the
Constitution aggressive, then was Washington aggressive.”
With these two authorities we cannot hesitate.
To all enemies we oppose “the Constitution and Washington.”</p>

<p>If attacks upon the Republican party here at home
have caused a different impression in any quarter, the
responsibility belongs to those who have constantly and
systematically maligned and misrepresented us. And
our severity of judgment should be reserved less for
the Southern States so much excited than for those at
the North who feed the flames.</p>

<p>Our duty is plain and bright before us,&mdash;plain as
day, and bright as the sun. It is simply to proceed as
we have begun, and to abide by our declared principles.
This is not the moment for any surrender to threats,
even if Massachusetts could ever yield to such compulsion.</p>

<p>It was the saying of Samuel Adams, in the early
stage of our Revolution, that we should be respected
abroad just in proportion to the firmness of our conduct.
And this is true now. The victory which we
have won can be assured only by such conduct, tempered
always by that wise moderation which is needful
even in victory. There should be no party act or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
hasty word to increase present responsibilities. Our
safety is in our principles. They are of living rock,
and no power can prevail against them.</p>

<p>Again I thank you. Good night.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="right medium"><span class="smcap">Boston</span>, November 22, 1860.</p>

<p class="dropcap">MY DEAR SIR,&mdash;Since our last conversation I
have received from Earl Spencer precise copies
of the two “Memorial Stones” of the English family
of George Washington, which I described to you as harmonizing
exactly with the pedigree having the sanction
of your authority.<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> The copies are, as I understand, of

and have the original inscriptions,&mdash;being in all respects

exact idea of those most interesting memorials in the
parish church near Althorp, in Brington, Northamptonshire.</p>

<p>The largest is of Lawrence Washington, father of
John Washington, who with his brother Lawrence emigrated
to America. It is a slab of bluish-gray sandstone,
and measures five feet nine inches long and two
feet six inches broad.</p>

<p>This is the inscription:&mdash;</p>

<p>Above the inscription, carved in the stone, are the
arms of the Washingtons, with the arms of the Butlers
<em>impaled</em>,&mdash;the latter being, in the language of heraldry,
<i>azure, a chevron between three covered cups or</i>.</p>

<p>The other stone is placed over Robert Washington
and Elizabeth his wife. Robert was uncle of the emigrant.
This is a slab of the same sandstone, and measures
three feet six inches long and two feet six inches
broad.</p>

<p>The inscription, on a small brass plate set into the
stone, is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span></p>

<p class="noindent center" style="line-height: 150%;">
<span class="smcap">Here lies interred y<sup>e</sup> bodies of Elizab: Washington<br />

</p>

<p>On a separate brass, beneath the inscription, are the
arms of the Washingtons, without any addition but a
crescent, the <em>mark of cadency</em>, which denotes the <em>second</em>
son. These, as you are well aware, have the combination
of stars and stripes, and are sometimes supposed to
have suggested our national flag. In heraldic language,
they are <i>argent, two bars gules, in chief three mullets
of the second</i>.</p>

<p>In the interesting chapter on the “Origin and Genealogy
of the Washington Family,” preserved in the
Appendix to your “Life of Washington,” it appears
that Lawrence, father of the emigrant, died 13th December,
and was buried at Brington 15th December,
1616. But the genealogical tables followed by you
furnish no indication of the locality of this church.
Had it appeared as the parish church of the Spencer
family, in Northamptonshire, the locality, which I believe
was unknown in our country, would have been
precisely fixed.</p>

<p>In fact, the slab covering Lawrence Washington is
in the chancel of the church, by the side of the monuments
of the Spencer family. These are all in admirable
preservation, with full-length effigies, busts, or other
sculptured work, and exhibit an interesting and connected
series of sepulchral memorials, from the reign of
Henry the Eighth to the present time. Among them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
is a monument by the early English sculptor, Nicholas
Stone; another by Nollekens from a design by Cipriani;
and another by Flaxman, with exquisitely beautiful
personifications of Faith and Charity. Beneath these
monuments repose successive representatives of this
illustrious family, whose aristocratic claims are enhanced
by services not only to the state, but also to
knowledge, as shown in the unique and world-famous
library collected by one of its members. In this companionship
is found the last English ancestor of our
Washington.</p>

<p>The other slab, covering Robert, uncle of the emigrant,
is in one of the aisles, where it is scraped by the
feet of all who pass.</p>

<p>The parish of Brington&mdash;written in Domesday Book
“Brinintone,” and also “Brintone,” in modern pronunciation
<i>Brighton</i>&mdash;is between seven and eight miles
from the town of Northampton, not far from the centre
of England. It contains about 2,210 acres, of which
about 1,490 belong to Earl Spencer, and about 326
to the rector in right of his church. The soil is
chiefly dark-colored loam, with a small tract of clay
towards the north. Nearly four fifths of the whole is
pasture.</p>

<p>In the village still stands the house said to have
been occupied by the Washingtons when the emigrant
brother left them. You will see a vignette of it on the
title-page of the recent English work entitled “The
Washingtons.” Over the door are carved the words,
<span class="smcap">The Lord geveth, the Lord taketh away, blessed
be the name of the Lord</span>; while the Parish Register
gives pathetic commentary, by showing that in the
very year when this house was built a child was born<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
and another died in this family.</p>

<p>The church, originally dedicated to the Virgin, stands
at the northeast angle of the village, and consists of an
embattled tower with five bells, nave, north and south
aisles, chancel, chapel, and modern porch. The tower
is flanked by buttresses of two stages. The present
fabric goes back in origin to the beginning of the fourteenth
century, nearly two hundred years before the
discovery of America. The chancel and chapel, where
repose the Spencers and Lawrence Washington, were
rebuilt by Sir John Spencer, purchaser of the estate, at
the beginning of the sixteenth century. They afford a
late specimen of Tudor architecture. The church is beautifully
situated on the highest ground of Brington, and
is surrounded by a stone wall lined with trees. Dibdin
says that a more complete picture of a country
churchyard is rarely seen. A well-trimmed walk encircles
the whole of the interior, while the fine Gothic
windows at the end of the chancel fill the scene with
picturesque beauty.</p>

<p>The Parish Register, which is still preserved, commences
in 1560. From this it appears that William
Proctor was rector from 1601 to 1627, partly contemporary
with the last Washingtons there. Other entries
occur, relating to this family.</p>

<p>Of a minister in this church we have an amusing
notice in Evelyn’s Memoirs, where the following contrast
is found, under date of August 18th, 1688: “Dr.
Jeffryes [a misnomer for <i>Jessop</i>], the minister of Althorp,
who was my Lord’s chaplain when Ambassador
in France, <em>preached the shortest discourse I ever heard</em>;
but what was defective in the amplitude of his sermon
he had supplied in the largeness and convenience of the
parsonage-house.”<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></p>

<p>Less than a mile from the church is the famous seat
of the Spencers, surrounded by a park of five hundred
acres, with one of the gates opening near the church.
Bordering on the churchyard are oak-trees which were
growing at the purchase of the estate in the reign of
Henry the Seventh. Evelyn was often here, a delighted
visitor. On one occasion he speaks of “the house, or
rather palace, at Althorp.”<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> Elsewhere he describes it
as “in a pretty open bottom, very finely watered, and
flanked with stately woods and groves in a park.”<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> An
engraving by the younger Luke Vorsterman, a Dutch
artist, attests the attraction of the place at this time.</p>

<p>One feature of the park excited the admiration of
Evelyn, and at a later day of Mrs. Jameson, who gives
to it some beautiful pages in her “Visits and Sketches
at Home and Abroad.” It is a record of the dates
when different plantations of trees were begun. While
recommending this practice in his “Sylva,” Evelyn remarks,
“The only instance I know of the like in our
own country is in the park at Althorp in Northamptonshire,
the magnificent seat of the Right Hon. the Earl of
Sunderland.”<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> Here are six of these commemorative
stones. The first records a wood planted by Sir John<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
Spencer, in 1567 and 1568; the second, a wood planted
by Sir John Spencer, son of the former, in 1589; the
third, a wood planted by Robert Lord Spencer, in 1602
and 1603; the fourth, a wood planted by Sir William
Spencer, Knight of the Bath, afterwards Lord Spencer,
in 1624. This stone is ornamented with the arms of
the Spencers, and on the back is inscribed, <span class="smcap">Vp and bee
doing and God will prosper</span>. In this scenery and
amidst these associations the Washingtons lived. When
the emigrant left, in 1657, the woods must have been
well grown. Not long afterwards they arrested the
attention of Evelyn. The fifth and sixth stones were
never seen by the Washingtons, or by Evelyn. They
were set up in 1798 and 1800, by George John, second
Earl Spencer, who planted trees as well as amassed
books.</p>

<p>The Household Books at Althorp show that for many
years the Washingtons were frequent guests. The hospitality
of this seat has been renowned. The Queen of
James the First and Prince Henry, on their way to
London in 1603, were welcomed there in an entertainment,
memorable for a Masque from the vigorous muse
of Ben Jonson.<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> Charles the First was at Althorp in
1647, when he received the first intelligence of those
approaching pursuers from whom he never escaped except
by the scaffold. In 1695, King William was there
for a week, and, according to Evelyn, “mightily entertained.”<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a>
At least one of the family was famous for
hospitality of a different character. Evelyn records that
he used to dine with the Countess of Sunderland,&mdash;the
title then borne by the Spencers,&mdash;when she invited<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
<em>fire-eaters</em>,<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> stone-eaters, and opera-singers, after the fashion
of the day.<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a></p>

<p>The family was early and constantly associated with
literature. Spenser, the poet, belonged to it, and dedicated
to one of its members, Alice Spencer, “the Ladie
Strange,” afterwards Countess of Derby, his “Tears of
the Muses.” For the same Alice Spencer Milton wrote
his “Arcades,” while Sir John Harrington celebrated
her memory by an epigram. The Sacharissa of Waller
was the Lady Dorothy Sydney, wife of the first Earl of
Sunderland, third Lord Spencer, who perished fighting
for King Charles the First at Newbury. I do not dwell
on other associations of a later day, as my object is
simply to indicate those which existed in the time of
the Washingtons.</p>

<p>“The nobility of the Spencers has been illustrated
and enriched by the trophies of Marlborough; but I
exhort them to consider the ‘Fairy Queen’ as the most
precious jewel of their coronet.” Thus wrote Gibbon in
his Memoirs,<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> and all must feel the beauty of the exhortation.
This nobility may claim another illustration
from ties of friendship and neighborhood with the
Washingtons. Perhaps hereafter our countrymen will
turn aside from their travels to visit the parish church
of Brington, in reverence for a spot so closely associated
with American history.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I trust that this little sketch, suggested by what I
saw at Althorp during a brief visit last autumn, will
not seem irrelevant. Besides my own personal impressions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
and the volumes quoted, I have relied upon
Dibdin’s “Ædes Althorpianæ,” so interesting to all
bibliographical students, and especially upon Baker’s
“History and Antiquities of the County of Northampton,”&mdash;one
of those magnificent local works which illustrate
English history,&mdash;to which you refer in your
Appendix.</p>

<p>The Memorial Stones, which I have received from
Lord Spencer, are of historic value; and I think that I
shall best carry out the generous idea of the giver by
taking care that they are permanently placed where
they can be seen by the public,&mdash;perhaps in the State-House,
near Chantrey’s beautiful statue of Washington,
if this should be agreeable to the Commonwealth.</p>

<p>Pray pardon this call upon your attention, and believe
me, my dear Sir, with much regard,</p>

<p>“I have the honor to present to the General Court, as a gift to the
Commonwealth of Massachusetts from one of its citizens, certain memorials
of great historic interest.</p>

<p>“The home and final resting-place of the ancestors of George Washington
were until recently unvisited by and unknown to Americans.
In the genealogical table appended to the ‘Life of Washington’ by
our distinguished fellow-citizen, Mr. Jared Sparks, it is stated that
Lawrence Washington, the father of John Washington (who emigrated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>to Virginia in 1657), was buried at Brington; but, though both Mr.
Sparks and Washington Irving visited Sulgrave, an earlier home of the
Washingtons, neither of these learned biographers appears by his works
to have repaired to this quiet parish in Northamptonshire.</p>

<p>“Our fellow-citizen, the Hon. Charles Sumner, on a recent visit to
England, identified certain inscriptions in the parish church of Brington,
near Althorp, as being those of the father and uncle of John Washington,
the emigrant to Virginia, who was the great-grandfather of the
Father of his Country.</p>

<p>“Earl Spencer, the proprietor of Althorp, sought out the quarry from
which, more than two centuries ago, these tablets were taken, and
caused others to be made which are exact <i>fac-similes</i> of the originals.
These he has presented to Mr. Sumner, who has expressed the desire
that memorials so interesting to all Americans may be placed where
they may be seen by the public, and has authorized me to offer them
to the Commonwealth, if it be the pleasure of the Legislature to order
them to be preserved in some public part of the State-House.</p>

<p>“I send with this a letter addressed to myself by the learned historian
of Washington, bearing testimony to the great interest of these memorials,
and expressing the desire that they may (Mr. Sumner assenting)
be placed in the Capitol.</p>

<p>“A letter from Mr. Sumner to Mr. Sparks also accompanies this Message,
describing the church at Brington, and some of the associations
which cluster around the resting-place of the ancestors of our Washington.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I enclose a copy of a highly interesting letter from
Mr. Charles Sumner, describing the church at Brington, near Althorp,
in Northamptonshire. In this church were deposited the remains of
Lawrence Washington, who was the father of John and Lawrence
Washington, the emigrants to America, and who was therefore the last
English ancestor of George Washington. A copy of the inscription on
the stone which covers the grave of Lawrence Washington, and also of
another inscription over the grave of his brother, Robert Washington,
who was buried in the same church, are given with exactness in Mr.
Sumner’s letter. As far as I am aware, these inscriptions are now for
the first time made known in this country.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>

<p>“Earl Spencer has sent to Mr. Sumner two stones, being from the
same quarry, and having the same form and dimensions, as the originals,
and containing a <i>fac-simile</i> of the inscriptions. It has been suggested
that these stones ought to be placed in the State-House, where
they may be accessible to the public, and my opinion on the subject
has been asked. As they are unquestionably genuine memorials of the
Washington family, and possess on this account a singular historical
interest, I cannot imagine that a more appropriate disposition of them
could be made. I understand that Mr. Sumner would cheerfully
assent to such an arrangement, and I cannot doubt that your Excellency
will be well inclined to take such measures as may effectually
aid in attaining so desirable an object.</p>

<p>This Address was at the invitation of the Young Men’s Republican
Union of New York, before whom the speech on the Republican party
had been given.<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> On the present occasion, William C. Bryant, justly
famous in our literature, took the chair and introduced Mr. Sumner in
the following words.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I am glad, my friends, to see so large an audience assembled for the
purpose of hearing one of our most accomplished scholars and orators discourse
on a subject lying apart from the ordinary strifes and immediate interests
of the day. Concerning the services rendered by Lafayette to our country,
to our own Republic, in the most critical stage of its existence, there is no
controversy. For them we are all grateful. For his personal character we
all cherish a high veneration. And your presence here to-night in such
numbers declares that there are multitudes among us who cherish and preserve
a warm admiration, a generous and purifying enthusiasm, for the
noble examples of self-sacrifice bequeathed to us by a generation which has
passed away. Among public men, in all times and all countries, among
all that class who have been actors in the events which make up the history
of the world, there are few, unfortunately, who can compare with
Lafayette in a course of steady, unswerving virtue. Attend, then, my
friends, to the portraiture of that virtue drawn and set before you in living
words by a great artist, Charles Sumner, of Boston, whom I now introduce
to this assembly.” [<i>Long continued cheering.</i>]</p>

</div>

<p>The newspapers speak of the assembly as crowded and enthusiastic,
in spite of stormy weather. The <i>Herald</i> says, “The cheering was protracted,
and the utmost enthusiasm was manifested by the audience.”
Even the <i>World</i> adds, “The lecturer was frequently and vociferously
applauded, and the audience gave evidence of deep interest in his remarks.”
From the report in the <i>Herald</i> it appears that the allusions
to Slavery were received always with “applause,” while, at the remark
of Lafayette attributing “the evils of France less to the madness of
violence than to compromise of conscience by timid men,”<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> there was
what the <i>Herald</i> calls “vehement and long continued applause, and
waving of hats and handkerchiefs.” The temper of the audience was
an illustration of prevailing sentiment.</p>

<p>Beside the newspaper report at the time, this address was printed at
New York in a pamphlet, but from notes of reporters without revision<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
or help from Mr. Sumner.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In selecting this subject, Mr. Sumner was governed by two considerations:
first, a long cherished desire to pay the homage justly
due in his opinion to an illustrious character whose place in history
was not yet determined, and, secondly, the conviction, that, in the
actual crisis of our affairs, such an example of fidelity would help to
fix popular sentiment. The sympathy of the audience in all the testimony
against Slavery, and especially in the condemnation of Compromise,
showed that the effort was appreciated. The report in the
<i>Herald</i> was headed “<i>Sumner on Slavery</i>.”</p>

<p>Rumors of compromise in certain quarters and menaces from the
South increased the anxiety of the more earnest to take advantage of
every opportunity for demonstration against Slavery. To all suggestions
of concession the North made haste to answer in the negative.
Already began that fidelity under which the Rebellion finally succumbed
and Slavery disappeared.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Mr. Sumner was especially pleased at the appreciation of this Address
as an effort against compromise,&mdash;shown by a letter from a
citizen of Kansas, who was present:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“How timely and impressively that bright example teaches adherence to
Liberty and Principle, and resistance to concession and compromise, at the
present crisis!”</p>

</div>

<p>A patriot citizen who heard it at Philadelphia, where it was given
before an immense audience, wrote:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Your Lecture has done more good than words can tell. There is no
such thing as calculating its value to our city.”</p>

</div>

<p>The <i>Pennsylvanian</i> of Philadelphia, after entitling it “Clear Grit
Abolitionism,” said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The People’s Literary Institute Lecture, at Concert Hall, last evening,
was by that perfect ensample of Abolitionism, Senator Sumner, of Massachusetts.
The hall was crowded, negroes occupying the front seats and
other prominent places. Sumner’s nominal subject was ‘Lafayette,’ but
he made his sketch of the noble Marquis a vehicle for the expression of the
most ardent wishes and aspirations after negro equality. The audience applauded
the most radical passages, although a stray hiss now and then betrayed
the whereabouts of a ‘Conservative.’”</p>

<h3>ADDRESS.</h3>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/line.png" width="80" height="16" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">MR. PRESIDENT,&mdash;I am to speak this evening
of one who early consecrated himself to Human
Rights, and throughout a long life became their representative,
knight-errant, champion, hero, missionary,
apostle,&mdash;who strove in this cause as no man in history
has ever striven,&mdash;who suffered for it as few have
suffered,&mdash;and whose protracted career, beginning at
an age when others are yet at school, and continued to
the tomb, where he tardily arrived, is conspicuous for
the rarest fidelity, the purest principle, and the most
chivalrous courage, whether civil or military. There is
but one personage to whom this description is justly
applicable, and you have anticipated me when I pronounce
the name of Lafayette. As in Germany Jean
Paul is known as “the Only One,” so would I hail Lafayette
as “the Faithful One.” If Liberty be what
philosophy, poetry, and the human heart all declare, then
must we treasure the example of one who served her
always with a lover’s fondness and with a martyr’s constancy,
nor demand perfections which do not belong to
human nature. It is enough for unstinted gratitude
that he stood forth her steadfast friend, like the good
angel,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse indent12">“unmoved,</div>
<div class="verse">Unshaken, unseduced, unterrified,&mdash;</div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span></p>
<p>trampling on all the blandishments of youth, of fortune,
and of power, keeping himself sternly aloof whether
from King or Emperor, and always insisting upon the
same comprehensive cause,&mdash;with a soul as fearless
and irreproachable as Bayard, from whom generals and
kings received knighthood, as unbending as Cato, who
singly stood out against Cæsar, and as gentle as that
best loved disciple, who leaned on the bosom of the
Saviour, and alone of all the Twelve followed him to
the Cross.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>If anything could add to the interest which this unparalleled
career is calculated to awaken, I should find
it in special associations which I have enjoyed. Often,
when in Paris halting about as an invalid, I turned
from its crowded life to visit the simple tomb of Lafayette
in the conventual cemetery of Picpus, watched
by white-hooded nuns, within the circle of the old
walls, where he lies by the side of his heroic wife,
pattern of noblest womanhood. Gazing on this horizontal
slab of red freestone, in shape like that of Albert
Dürer in the republican graveyard of Nuremberg, bearing
an inscription without title of any kind, and then
casting my eyes upon the neighboring monuments,
where every name has the blazon of prince or noble,
I seemed to see before me that youthful, lifelong, and
incomparable loyalty to a great cause with perfect consistency
to the end, marking him a phenomenon of history,
which will be my theme to-night. The interest
inspired at the republican tomb was strengthened at Lagrange,
the country home of Lafayette, a possession derived
from the family of his wife, where he passed the
last thirty years of life in patriarchal simplicity, surrounded
by children and grandchildren, with happy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
guests, and where everything still bears witness to
him.</p>

<p>Nor do I believe that my interest goes far beyond
that of the American people, when I think how his
name is a household word, dear to all alike, old and
young. Even the list of post-offices in the United
States shows no less than fifty with his venerated name,
and eighteen with the name of Lagrange.</p>

<p>Just before leaving France, now a year ago, on a clear
and lovely day of October, in company with a friend, I
visited this famous seat, which at once reminded me of
the prints of it so common at shop-windows in my
childhood. It is a picturesque and venerable castle,
with five round towers, a moat, a drawbridge, an arched
gateway, ivy-clad walls, and a large court-yard within,
embosomed in trees, except on one side, where a beautiful
lawn spreads its verdure. Everything speaks to us.
The castle itself is of immemorial antiquity,&mdash;supposed
to have been built in the earliest days of the French
monarchy, as far back as Louis le Gros. It had been
tenanted by princes of Lorraine, and been battered by
the cannon of Turenne, one of whose balls penetrated
its thick masonry. The ivy so luxuriantly mantling
the gate, with the tower by its side, was planted by the
eminent British statesman, Charles Fox, on a visit during
the brief peace of Amiens. The park owed much
of its beauty to Lafayette himself. The situation harmonized
with the retired habits which found shelter
there from the storms of fortune. It is in the level
district of Brie, famous for its cheese, and forming part
of the province of Champagne, famous for its wine,&mdash;about
forty-five miles to the east of Paris, remote from
any high-road, and at some distance from the railway<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
recently opened through the neighborhood, in a country
rich with orchards and smiling with fertility of all kinds.
The estate immediately about the castle contains six
hundred acres, which in the time of Lafayette was
enlarged by several outlying farms. The well-filled
library occupied an upper room in one of the towers,
and near a window overlooking the farm-yard still
stood the desk at which Lafayette was in the habit of
sitting, with the speaking-trumpet by which he made
himself heard in the yard, and with the account-book
of the farm lying open as he had left it. All about
were souvenirs of our country, showing how it engaged
his thoughts. The castle is now occupied by the family
of one of his grandchildren, whose hospitable welcome
to us as Americans gave token of their illustrious ancestor,
hardly less than these precious memorials and
the full-length portrait by Ary Scheffer which looked
down from the walls.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>And now holding up to view a model of surpassing
fidelity in support of Human Rights, I am not without
hope that others may see the beauty of such a character
and try to make it in some measure their own. There
is need of it among us. We, too, must be faithful.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Gilbert de Motier, Marquis de Lafayette, only child
of an ancient house, was born 6th September, 1757, at
the castle of Chavaniac, in the central and mountainous
province of Auvergne, in France. He came into the
world an orphan,&mdash;for his father, a colonel of grenadiers
in the French army, had already perished at the Battle
of Minden. The verses which once interested Burns
and excited the youthful admiration of Scott, though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
suggested by a humbler lot, depict some of the circumstances
which surrounded his:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Cold on Canadian hills or <em>Minden’s plain</em>,</div>
<div class="verse">Perhaps that parent mourned her soldier slain,</div>

</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The mother died soon after, leaving her child alone in
the world, with rank and fortune such as few possess.</p>

<p>In the Memoirs, written by his own hand, Lafayette
mentions simply his birth, without allusion to family
or ancestry. This was characteristic of one who had
so completely renounced all such distinctions. But the
temptations he overcame and the prejudices he encountered
can be fully appreciated only when we know his
origin. His family was not merely ancient and noble,
but for generations historic. It had given to French
renown a Marshal, who, after honorable service in Italian
campaigns, fought by the side of the Maid of Orléans
in the expulsion of the English from France; and
it had added to the more refined glories of the nation
an authoress of that name, the friend of Rochefoucauld
and Madame de Sévigné, who shone by literary genius
at the court of Louis the Fourteenth, and became an
early example of what woman may accomplish: so
that the young orphan bore a name which, in a land
of hereditary distinctions, seemed to enlist him for
their conservation, while it gave him everywhere an
all-sufficient passport.</p>

<p>But as some are born poets and others are born
mathematicians, the Marquis de Lafayette was born
with instinctive fidelity to the great principles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span> of Liberty
and Equality, by the side of which all hereditary
distinctions disappear. Liberty, he had the habit of saying,
was with him a religion, a love, and a geometrical
certainty; and this passion, thus sacred, ardent, and
confident, was inborn, perpetual, and irresistible. While
still a child in the seclusion of Auvergne, he sighed for
dangerous adventure, and when at the age of eleven he
was transferred to college at Paris, the soul of the young
noble responded instinctively to all instances of republican
virtue. In the child may be seen the man, and
he delighted afterwards to remember that during those
early years, when the heart showed itself as it was, in a
school exercise describing “the perfect horse,” he lost
the prize by picturing the noble animal as throwing his
rider at sight of the whip. Nor did his ardent nature
express itself in superficial sallies. At every period of
life, and particularly in youth, he was grave and silent
even to coldness,&mdash;thus in external manner differing
from the giddy and ostentatious nobles of his day, as he
contrasted with them in character.</p>

<p>An early marriage, at the age of sixteen, with the
remarkable daughter of the ducal house of Noailles, enlarged
his aristocratic connections, and completed all
that heart could desire for happiness or worldly advancement.
But the life of a courtier, even with the
companionship of royal princes, did not satisfy his earnest
nature, and he turned away from the grandeurs
and follies of Versailles to follow in the steps of his
father as captain in the French army. Stationed at
Metz, a border fortification on the Rhenish frontier of
France, an incident occurred which gave impulse and
direction to his life.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span></p>
<p>The Duke of Gloucester, brother of King George the
Third, smarting under slights at court on account of a
marriage disagreeable to the King, turned his back upon
England, and in his travels stopped at Metz, where he
was welcomed at dinner by the commander of the garrison.
At that table sat the youthful Lafayette, only
nineteen years old, who there for the first time heard
the story of the American “insurgents,” as they were
called,&mdash;of their armed resistance to British troops,
and of the Declaration of Independence. His whole
nature was thrilled, and the passionate declamation
against arbitrary power to which the English Duke
gave vent, though stirred only by wounded pride and
spite, fell like a spark upon his sincere and sensitive
soul, already kindling with generous emotions, so that,
before the dinner was ended, his resolution was fixed to
cross the ocean and offer his sword to distant, unknown
fellow-men struggling for liberty. This was in the autumn
of 1776.<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> Hastening back to Paris, he lost no
time in engaging with the American Commissioners
there, who with grateful astonishment welcomed their
romantic ally.</p>

<p>Meanwhile came tidings of melancholy reverses which
followed the Declaration of Independence, and of the
scanty forces of Washington tracking the snow with
bloody feet, as they retreated through New Jersey,&mdash;seeming
to announce that all was lost. The American
Commissioners frankly confessed that they could not
encourage Lafayette to proceed with his purpose. But
his undaunted temper was quickened anew, and when
they told him that with their damaged credit it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
impossible to provide a vessel for his conveyance, he
exclaimed: “Thus far you have seen my zeal only;
now it shall be something more. I will purchase and
equip a vessel myself. It is while danger presses that
I wish to join your fortunes.” Noble words, worthy of
immortality, and never to be heard without a throb by
an American heart!</p>

<p>Before embarking, Lafayette, partly to mask his enterprise,
and also in the hardihood of courage, visited
England, where his wife’s uncle, the French ambassador,
presented him to George the Third, who, unconscious of
his purpose, said, “I hope you mean to stay some time
in Britain”; to which he answered, that it was not in
his power. “What obliges you to leave us?” asked the
King. “Please your Majesty,” said our new ally, “I
have a very particular engagement; and if your Majesty
were aware of it, you would not desire me to stay.”
During this visit everything was open to the youthful
soldier, and he was even invited to attend the review
of British troops about to embark for America. From
instinctive delicacy he declined, thinking it not right
to take advantage of a hospitable invitation to inspect
troops against whom he was about to array himself in
war. “But,” he added, in relating this incident, “I met
them six months after at the Brandywine.”</p>

<p>Quitting England, he traversed France with secrecy
and despatch to join his vessel, which was at a Spanish
port, beyond French jurisdiction. His departure came
like a bolt upon the English Court, which he had just
left, also upon the French Court, which was not yet prepared
for a break with England, and upon his most
affectionate family, who were planning for him a tour
in Italy, which in his busy life he never made; but his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
young wife, who suffered most, loved him too well
not to partake his sentiments and to approve his generous
resolution, even though it separated him from her.
To illustrate the general sensation, I quote the words of
the historian Gibbon, in a letter dated April 12, 1777.
“We talk chiefly of the Marquis de Lafayette, who was
here a few weeks ago. He is about twenty, with an
hundred and thirty thousand livres a year, the nephew
of Noailles, who is ambassador here. He has bought
the Duke of Kingston’s yacht, and is gone to join the
Americans.<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> His family interfered by peremptory
command, and the French Government interfered by
that arbitrary mandate, under seal of the King, known
as <i>lettre-de-cachet</i>,&mdash;but, disregarding the one and evading
the other, in the disguise of a courier, our devoted
ally traversed the Pyrenees, and soon found himself
with his companions in arms on board his vessel, which,
on the 26th of April, 1777, set sail for America.</p>

<p>Undertaking this enterprise at a time when the sea
and all beyond were little known, the youthful adventurer
showed a heart of “triple oak.” Our admiration
is enhanced, when we recall the charms of country, rank,
and family left behind,&mdash;with perils of capture and
war braved even before reaching the land,&mdash;and especially
when we contemplate the motive in which this
enterprise had its origin. Rarely has hero gone forth
on so beautiful an errand; for he carried words of cheer
to our fathers, then in despairing struggle for the Great
Declaration, and opened the way for those fleets and
armies of France soon after marshalled on our side;
nor is it too much to say, that he was the good angel of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
Independence. His family correspondence, which has
seen the light only since his death, exhibits his beautiful
fidelity and the completeness of his dedication to
our cause. In a letter to his distinguished father-in-law,
announcing his purpose, he says of American interests,
that they “will always be more dear to him than his
own,” and then declares himself “at the height of joy at
having found so fine an occasion to do something and to
improve himself.”<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> In a letter to his wife, written on
the voyage, under date of June 7, 1777, his sympathy
with the great objects of the national contest is tenderly
revealed. “I hope, for my sake,” he writes, in words
worthy of everlasting memory, “that you will become
a good American. This is a sentiment proper for virtuous
hearts. Intimately allied to the happiness of the
whole Human Family is that of America, destined to become
the respectable and sure asylum of virtue, honesty,
toleration, equality, and of a tranquil liberty.”<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> Where
are nobler words of aspiration for our country than this
simple testimony by a youth of nineteen, pouring out
his heart to his wife of seventeen? Where in history are
grander words from youth or man? For seven weeks
laboring through the sea, yet sustained by thoughts like
these, he arrived at last on the coast of South Carolina.
It was dark, but, pushing ashore in a boat, and following
the guidance of a light, he found himself under a
friendly roof. His first word, as he touched the land,
was a vow to conquer or perish with it.</p>

<p>The Continental Congress was then sitting at Philadelphia,
and, without stopping for rest, the sea-worn
voyager hastened to report himself there. Most of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
way on horseback, for nine hundred miles, he journeyed
on, enjoying the country in its native freshness, and the
simple, cordial welcome which greeted him everywhere
on the road. “The further North I advance,” thus he
wrote to his wife, “the more I like this country and
its people.”<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> He had already been struck by what
to him were “black domestics who came to ask his
orders.”<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> Then for the first time he looked upon a
slave. His well-known sentiments, so constantly declared,
show clearly how his candid nature must have
been troubled. He had forsaken France, where, amidst
gross inequalities of condition, this grossest was unknown,&mdash;where,
in the descending ranks of the feudal
hierarchy, there was no place for this degradation,&mdash;where,
amidst unjust taxes and injurious privileges
without number, every man had a right at least to his
child, to his wife, and to himself,&mdash;and where the boast
went forth, as in England, and was repeated by judicial
tribunals, that the air was too pure for a slave. With
heavenly generosity he had turned away from his own
country to help the cause of Freedom in another hemisphere,
and here he found man despoiled of all <em>personal</em>
rights, and even degraded to be property, by those whose
own struggles merely for <em>political</em> rights had thrilled
the fibres of his being. Youthful, and little schooled
as yet in the world, he must have recoiled instinctively,
as this most dismal and incomprehensible inconsistency
appeared before him. How faithfully he battled with
the demon his life will show.</p>

<p>Arrived in Philadelphia, he announced that he had
come to serve at his own expense and as volunteer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>.
The Continental Congress, touched by the magnanimous
devotion of the youthful stranger, and apprised of
his distinguished connections at home, appointed him
without delay Major-General in the army of the United
States, where he took rank by the side of Gates and
Greene, Lincoln and Lee. Born to exalted condition in
an ancient monarchy, he found himself welcomed to the
highest place in the military councils of a struggling
republic, and this while still a youth under twenty,&mdash;younger
than Fox, younger than Pitt, when they astonished
the world by their precocious parliamentary powers,&mdash;younger
than Condé, in his own beautiful France,
on the field of Rocroi. And his modesty was not less
eminent than his post. To Washington, who made
apologies for exhibiting his troops before a French
officer, he replied with interesting simplicity, “I have
come to learn, and not to teach.”<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> The Commander-in-Chief,
usually so grave, was won at once to that perpetual
friendship which endured unbroken as long as
life,&mdash;showing itself now in tears of joy and then in tears
of grief,&mdash;watching the youthful stranger with paternal
care,&mdash;sharing with him table, tent, and on the field of
Monmouth the same cloak for a couch,&mdash;following his
transcendent fortunes, now on giddiest heights and then
in gloom, with constant, unabated attachment,&mdash;corresponding
with him at all times,&mdash;addressing him in
terms of unwonted endearment as “the man he loved,”<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a>
and saying again that he “had not words to express
his affection, were he to attempt it,”<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a>&mdash;sending kindly
sympathy to that devoted wife in her unparalleled affliction,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
and pleading across sea and continent with the
Austrian despot for his release from the dungeons of
Olmütz.</p>

<p>It is much to have inspired the most tender friendship
which history records in the life of Washington.
There were with us other strangers, scarcely less brilliant
than Lafayette. There was Kosciusko, the Pole,
who afterwards played so great a part in his own country&mdash;Steuben,
the German, who did so much for the
discipline of our troops,&mdash;De Kalb, the gallant soldier,
who died for us at Camden,&mdash;Rochambeau, the distinguished
commander of the French forces, compeer
with Washington at Yorktown,&mdash;Lauzun, the sparkling
courtier, whose fascinations were acknowledged by
Marie Antoinette,&mdash;Ségur, the high-bred youthful soldier
and future diplomatist,&mdash;Montesquieu, grandson of
the immortal author of the “Spirit of Laws,”&mdash;Saint-Simon,
whose military and ancestral honors are now
lost in his fame as social reformer,&mdash;also the unfortunate
Count de Loménie, with the Prince de Broglie of
the old monarchy, and Berthier, afterwards a prince of
the Empire. All these were in our revolutionary contest
gathered about Washington; but Lafayette alone
obtained place in his heart. Friendship is always a
solace and delight; but such a friendship was a testimony.
Let it ever be said that Washington chose Lafayette
as friend, while Lafayette was to him always
pupil, disciple, son.</p>

<p>His intrepidity found early occasion for display at
the Battle of the Brandywine, where, attempting to rally
our unlucky troops, he was severely wounded in the
leg, and thus at once, by suffering for us, increased his
titles to regard. As he became known, his simple and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
bountiful nature awakened the attachment of officers
and men, so that in writing to his wife he was able
to relieve her anxieties by saying that he had “the
friendship of the army in gross and in detail,” and
also what he calls “a tender union with the most respectable,
the most admirable of men, General Washington.”<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a>
Nor was this unnatural, when we consider
how completely he became American in dress, food, and
habits, as he was already American in heart. Avoiding
no privation or fatigue, this juvenile patrician, educated
to indulgence in all the forms that wealth and privilege
could supply, showed himself more frugal and
more austere even than his republican associates, living
sometimes for months on a single ration. The confidence
of Congress soon followed, and by special resolution
Washington was requested to place him at the
head of an independent command.</p>

<p>Meanwhile France openly enlisted on our side. Turgot,
the philosopher, and Necker, the financier, counselled,
as far-sighted ministers, against this step, which
launched the ancient monarchy in a dangerous career.
Jealous of a rival power, smarting under recent reverses,
and brooding over the accumulated rancors of long
generations, the Court was willing to embarrass England,
yet covertly and without the hazard of open war.
The King himself never sympathized with the American
cause. But public opinion, which in that nation
inclines to generous ideas, was moved by the news of
a distant people waging a contest for Human Rights,
at first doubtful, and then suddenly illumined by the
victory of Saratoga,&mdash;while Franklin, the philosopher
and diplomatist, our unequalled representative at Paris,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
challenged the admiration alike of grave and gay, and
the example of Lafayette touched the heart of France.
These wrought so far, that Court and King were obliged
to bend before the popular will, and then came the
Treaty of Alliance with the Colonies by which their
place in the Family of Nations was assured. The Treaty
was communicated to the British Court, with a note referring
Independence to the Declaration of the 4th of
July, on which Lafayette, with constant instinct for
popular rights, exclaimed, “Here is a principle of national
sovereignty which will some day be recalled at
home.”<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> Of course, if Americans could become independent
by a Declaration, so could Frenchmen.</p>

<p>The duties of Frenchman were now superadded to
the duties Lafayette had assumed toward our cause.
“As long,” said he, in a letter to Congress, “as I thought
I could dispose of myself, I made it my pride and pleasure
to fight under American colors in defence of a
cause which I dare more particularly call <em>ours</em> because
I had the good luck to bleed for it. Now that
France is involved in a war, I am urged by a sense of
duty, as well as by patriotic love, to present myself
before the King, and know in what manner he judges
proper to employ my services. The most agreeable of
all will always be such as may enable me to serve the
common cause among those whose friendship I have
had the happiness to obtain, and whose fortune I have
had the honor to follow in less smiling times.” Congress
responded by unlimited leave of absence, with permission
to return at his own convenient time, and by
a vote of grateful thanks and a sword, together with a
letter to the French King, where they said, “We recommend<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
this young nobleman to your Majesty’s notice, as
one whom we know to be wise in council, gallant in the
field, and patient under the hardships of war.”<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> Never
before did Frenchman return from service abroad with
such a letter to his king.</p>

<p>On his way to embark at Boston, he was attacked by
a fever, which in its violence seemed about to prevail,
so that Washington dwelt on the daily tidings of the
physician “with tears in his eyes,” and it was reported
at one time that “the soldier’s friend,” as he was called,
had died.<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> Happily he was spared to his two countries,
and to the affection of his commander. Always true to
Liberty, he would not let the crew of the frigate waiting
for him at Boston be recruited by impressment,&mdash;thus
in all things guarding the rights of the people.<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a></p>

<p>If the sensation in Europe caused by his departure
had been great, that caused by his return, after two
years of brilliant service, with eminent military rank,
with the thanks of Congress and the friendship of
Washington, was greater far. He could not appear
anywhere without greetings of admiration which knew
no bounds, while, to borrow his own account, he was
“consulted by all the ministers, and, what is much better,
kissed by all the women.”<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> In a journey to his estate,
the towns through which he passed honored him with
processions and civic pomp. But his distant friends,
struggling for the Great Declaration, were never out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
of mind. Accustomed to large interests sustained by
small means, he regretted each <i>fête</i> even in his own
honor as a diversion of supplies, while his zeal went
so far as to make the Prime-Minister, M. de Maurepas,
declare that for this cause Lafayette would strip Versailles
of its furniture. Such an influence, so sincere
and so constant, from one who spoke not only as a
French noble, but as a Major-General of the American
army, was not without result. The papers of Lafayette
attest the ability with which he pressed upon the
French Government an active participation in the contest,
and especially prompted the decisive expedition of
Rochambeau.</p>

<p>But he did not loiter at home. Soon he turned from
country and family. Again he crossed the sea, and this
time landed at Boston, for which, at a later day, he
recorded a “predilection,”<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> chiefly, it appears, because
there were no slaves there, and all were equal. The
hearts of the people everywhere throbbed with welcome;
the army partook of this delight, and Washington now
“shed tears of joy.”<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> The republican sentiments which
animated him appear in the present of a flag to one of
our battalions, with a simple wreath of laurel blending
with a civic crown, and the words beneath, “<em>No other</em>.”<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a>
Farewell to crowns and coronets, to kings and nobles!
Such was the great lesson of the flag. Then commenced
the second part of his American career,&mdash;his active
military service,&mdash;his command in Virginia,&mdash;his campaign
against Cornwallis, when the latter said triumphantly,
“The boy shall not escape me,”&mdash;and his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
coöperation in the final assault at Yorktown, ending in
the capitulation of the British commander to the combined
forces of America and France,&mdash;all of which belongs
to the history of both countries.</p>

<p>The campaign in Virginia redounded to the praise of
Lafayette in no common measure. After announcing
his designation for this service, and saying that “the
command of the troops in that State cannot be in better
hands,” Washington proceeds:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“He possesses uncommon military talents, is of a quick
and sound judgment, persevering, and enterprising without
rashness; and besides these, he is of a very conciliating
temper and perfectly sober, which are qualities that rarely
combine in the same person. And were I to add that some
men will gain as much experience in the course of three or
four years as some others will in ten or a dozen, you cannot
deny the fact and attack me upon that ground.”<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Madison wrote at the time that “his having baffled
and finally reduced to the defensive so powerful an
army as we now know he had to contend with, and with
so disproportionate a force, would have done honor to
the most veteran officer.”<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> The General Assembly of
Virginia, by solemn resolution, conceived in the warmest
terms of affection and applause, acknowledged “his
many great and important services to this Commonwealth
in particular, and through it to the United
States in general,” and tendered to him therefor “the
grateful thanks of the free representatives of a free people.”
They also directed a marble bust of him, “as a
lasting monument of his merit and of their gratitude.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
This judgment was sanctioned by the highest authorities,
including Washington.<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> A recent author adds to this
testimony by speaking of the campaign as “masterly,”
and then characterizes it as “the most brilliant, as well
as the most successful, part of his whole public career.”<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a>
But this judgment strangely forgets that lifelong loyalty
to Human Rights which in itself is a campaign beyond
any in war.</p>

<p>Grim-visaged war now smoothed its wrinkled front,
and, in the lull which ensued after the surrender of
Cornwallis, Lafayette returned again to France, with
the renewed thanks of Congress, and with added trusts.
Our ministers abroad were instructed to consult him.
The youthful soldier was changed into the more youthful
diplomatist; nor was he less efficient in the new
field. His presence alone was for our country an Embassy.
Through him the haughty Spanish Court was
approached, and gigantic forces were gathered at Cadiz
for an expedition in the common cause. At the same
time his republican character was so far recognized, that
the Spanish monarch, anticipating the capture of Jamaica,
exclaimed, “Lafayette must not be its governor,
as he would make it a republic.”<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> Great Britain bowed
before the storm and signed the Treaty of Peace, by
which American Independence was recognized. It was
fit that this great news should reach Congress through
our greatest benefactor. It was first known by a letter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
from Lafayette, dated at <i>Cadiz, February 5, 1783</i>; so that
he who had espoused our cause in its gloom became the
herald of its final triumph.</p>

<p>But another letter, bearing date the same day and
forwarded by the same vessel with that announcing the
glad tidings, opens another duty which already occupied
his inmost soul. Thus he writes to Washington, under
date of <i>Cadiz, February 5, 1783</i>,<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> and the remarkable
coincidence of dates shows how closely he associated
the rights of the African slave with our National Independence.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Now, my dear General, that you are going to enjoy
some ease and quiet, permit me to propose a plan to you,
which might become greatly beneficial to the black part of
mankind. Let us unite in purchasing a small estate where
we may try the experiment to free the negroes and use
them only as tenants. Such an example as yours might
render it a general practice; and if we succeed in America,
I will cheerfully devote a part of my time to render the
method fashionable in the West Indies. <em>If it be a wild scheme,
I had rather be mad this way than to be thought wise in the
other task.</em>”<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a></p>

</div>

<p>As if this great proposition were not enough, Lafayette,
in the same letter, calls upon Washington to employ
himself “in inducing the people of America to
strengthen their Federal Union,” saying, “It is a work
in which it behooves you to be concerned; I look upon
it as a necessary measure.” Thus were Emancipation
and Union conjoint in his regard.</p>

<p>At the date of this letter Lafayette was not yet
twenty-six years of age, and now, one struggle ended, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
begins another greater still, or rather he gives to the first
its natural development, and shows how truly he accepts
the truths declared by our fathers. Others might hesitate;
he does not. In these few words addressed to
Washington will be seen the same spirit which inspired
him originally to enlist for us, the same instinctive
love of Liberty, the same self-sacrifice, the same generosity,
the same nobleness, expressed with affecting
simplicity and frankness. Valuable as is this testimony
for the African race, it is also precious in illustration
of that remarkable character, which, from the beginning,
was guided by no transient spirit of adventure,
but by a sentiment almost divine for Human
Rights. In this light his original consecration to our
cause assumes new dignity, while American Independence
becomes but a stage in the triumphs of that Liberty
which is the common birthright of all mankind. If
Fox was a <em>boy-debater</em>, as he has been called, then was
Lafayette a <em>boy-hero</em>,&mdash;and hero of Humanity he continued
to the end.</p>

<p>During the next year, at the pressing invitation of
Washington, he again crossed the ocean, to witness the
peaceful prosperity of the country whose government
he had helped to found by twofold service in war and
in diplomacy. Adopted child of the Republic, he surrendered
himself for six months to the sympathies of the
people, the delights of friendship, and the companionship
of Washington, whom he visited at Mount Vernon,
and with whom he journeyed. Nor did his partiality for
Boston fail at this time, as a contemporary record shows.
“The reception I met with in Boston,” he wrote, “no
words can describe; at least it is impossible to express
what I have felt.”<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> But, far more than all, the Slavery<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
of the African race interested his heart, and would not
allow him to be silent. In official answers to addresses
of welcome from Legislatures of Southern States, he declared
his desire to see these Legislatures commence the
work of Abolition.<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> This was in 1784, before Clarkson,
then a youth at the University, was inspired to write
his Essay against Slavery, which was the glorious beginning
of his lifelong career, and before Wilberforce
brought forward his memorable motion in the British
Parliament for the abolition of the slave-trade. If these
words were of little effect at that early day, they bear
witness none the less to the exalted spirit of their
author. In taking leave of Congress, as he was about
to embark, he let drop other words, exhibiting the same
spirit, wherein may be seen the mighty shadow of the
Future. “May this immense temple of Freedom,” he
said, “ever stand <em>a lesson to oppressors</em>, <em>an example to the
oppressed</em>, a sanctuary for the rights of mankind! and
may these happy United States attain that complete
splendor and prosperity which will illustrate the blessings
of their government, and for ages to come rejoice
the departed souls of its founders!”<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> Such utterance
by a French noble tells that the Revolution was approaching.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span></p>

<p>The friendship of Washington and Lafayette deserves
more than passing mention. It constitutes a memorable
part in the life of each. Already we have witnessed
its beginning. They saw each other for the last
time at Annapolis, where Washington had taken his
welcome guest in his carriage from Mount Vernon.
There they parted, Washington returning to his peaceful
home, Lafayette hastening across the ocean to the
great destinies and the great misfortunes which awaited
him. But before leaving our shores he wrote a
letter from his ship, where he pours out his devotion
to his great chief, calling him “the most beloved of
all friends he ever had or ever shall have anywhere,”
declaring his regret that he cannot have “the inexpressible
pleasure of embracing him in his own house,
of welcoming him in a family where his name is
adored,” and to this adding: “Everything that admiration,
respect, gratitude, friendship, and filial love can
inspire is combined in my affectionate heart to devote
me most tenderly to you. In your friendship I find a
delight which words cannot express.”<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> Though never
meeting again, their intimacy was prolonged by an
interchange of letters, the most remarkable of any
in the life of either, by which their friendship is
made one, and each lives doubly in the affection of the
other.</p>

<p>Returned to Europe, Lafayette sought constant opportunities
to promote our interests,&mdash;writing especially
of Jefferson, our Minister at Paris, that he was “happy
to be his aide-de-camp.”<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> Nor did he confine his exertions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
to France. Traversing Germany, from Brunswick
to Vienna, he was everywhere a welcome guest, first with
the Emperor, and then with the King of Prussia, who
was the famous Frederick, sometimes called the Great,&mdash;described
by Lafayette, in a picture worthy of a
Dutch artist, as “an old, decrepit, and dirty corporal,
all covered with Spanish snuff, the head almost resting
on one shoulder, and fingers almost dislocated by the
gout.”<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> Cornwallis of Yorktown, who was there as a
visitor also, confessed that at the camp in Silesia “there
was a most marked preference for Lafayette.”<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> But
wherever the hero appeared, our concerns, whether political
or commercial, were still present to his thoughts.
At the table of Frederick he vindicated American institutions,
and especially answered doubts with regard
to “the strength of the Union,” which he upheld always
as a fundamental condition of national prosperity. He
confidently looked to our Independence as the fruitful
parent of a new order of ages, being that rightful
self-government, above all hereditary power, whether of
kings or nobles, which he proudly called the “American
Era.”</p>

<p>His heart was ever intent on projects of Human Improvement.
Aroused by the disabilities of Protestants
in France, amounting to absolute outlawry, sad heritage
of that fatal measure, the revocation of the Edict of
Nantes, Lafayette, though himself a Catholic, entered
into earnest efforts for their liberation, and thus enrolled
himself among champions of Religious Freedom.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
At the same time his opposition to African slavery assumed
a practical form. Washington acknowledged his
appeal from Cadiz, of 5th February, 1783, but unhappily
deferred action.<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> Lafayette went forward alone. At an
expense of 125,000 francs, this foremost of Abolitionists
purchased a plantation of slaves in the French colony
of Cayenne, that by emancipation he might try the
great experiment of Free Labor, and set an example to
mankind.<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> The spirit of this enterprise was seen on
the arrival of the agent from Paris, who began by collecting
all the slave-whips and other instruments of
punishment on the plantation, and burning them in
presence of the slaves. This was in 1785, two years
after the original proposition to Washington, who, on
learning its execution, thus complimented his more than
disciple:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The benevolence of your heart, my dear Marquis, is so
conspicuous upon all occasions that I never wonder at any
fresh proofs of it; but your late purchase of an estate in the
colony of Cayenne, with a view of emancipating the slaves
on it, is a generous and noble proof of your humanity.
Would to God a like spirit might diffuse itself generally
into the minds of the people of this country! But I despair
of seeing it.”<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Alas! had Washington at that time united with Lafayette,
there would have been a living example of untold
value to our country, instead of that dead despair
which was like a stone wall in the path of Progress.
Who can imagine the good from such an instance,
teaching the priceless benefits of Freedom? Who can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
estimate its happy influence in extinguishing that great
controversy which is not yet ended? It is sad to think
that such an opportunity was lost.</p>

<p>While organizing Emancipation in the distant colony
of Cayenne, Lafayette gave other evidence to his
American friends. In a letter to John Adams, our
Minister in London, dated February 22, 1786, he expresses
himself with a vigor never surpassed during the
long warfare with Slavery. “In the cause of my black
brethren,” he writes, “I feel myself warmly interested,
and most decidedly side, so far as respects them, <em>against
the white part of mankind</em>. Whatever be the complexion
of the enslaved, it does not, in my opinion, alter the
complexion of the crime which the enslaver commits,
a crime much blacker than any African face.”<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a></p>

<p>The following brief note to Alexander Hamilton is
another gem of character.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="right medium">“<span class="smcap">Paris</span>, April 13, 1785.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">My Dear Hamilton</span>,&mdash; … In one of your New York
Gazettes I find an association <em>against the slavery of negroes</em>,
which seems to me worded in such a way as to give no
offence to the moderate men in the Southern States. As I
ever have been <em>partial to my brethren of that color</em>, I wish, if
you are one in the society, you would move, in your own
name, for my being admitted on the list. My best respects
wait on Mrs. Hamilton. Adieu.</p>

<p class="sig">“Your affectionate friend,</p>

<p class="sig2">“<span class="smcap">Lafayette</span>.”<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a></p>

</div>

<p>How much in little! The testimony is plain. The
witness is a volunteer. In simple words he records himself
once more “against the slavery of negroes,” and then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
declares that he has ever been “partial to his brethren
of that color.” For him the degraded slave is brother,
although of a color not his own.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>That great event was now at hand, which, beginning
in a claim of rights denied, and inspired by generous
ideas, was destined, amidst falling privileges and toppling
thrones, to let loose the most direful furies of Discord
and War,&mdash;to feed the scaffold with blood of King
and Queen, and of good men in all the ranks of life,&mdash;to
lift the nation to unknown heights of audacity and
power,&mdash;to dash back the hosts of foreign invasion, as
the angry surge from the rock,&mdash;to achieve victory on
a scale of grandeur never witnessed since the eagles of
Cæsar passed from Britain to Egypt,&mdash;and, finally, to
mark a new epoch in the history of the Human Family.
The French Revolution had come. It was foreshadowed
in the writings of philosophers, in the gradual march of
Human Progress, in the wide-spread influence of the
American Revolution, in the growing instincts of the
people, and the obvious injustice of existing things,&mdash;and
it was begun in the example of Lafayette. Of all
men, he was its natural leader, just so long as it continued
moderate and humane. Alas, that such a cause,
so beautiful in itself and so grand in promise, was wrested
from its original character by the passions of men!</p>

<p>The initial step was the Assembly of the Notables,
February 22d, 1787, brought together for the first
time since its convocation to serve the arbitrary rule
of Cardinal Richelieu. There sat the two brothers
of the King, all the princes of the blood, archbishops,
bishops, dukes, peers, the chancellor, high officials of the
magistracy, and distinguished nobles, convoked by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
King in the interest of his crown. But the people had
no representative there. Lafayette became their representative.
As he had formerly drawn his sword, so
now he raised his voice for popular rights; nor was he
deterred by the courtly presence. Startled by his boldness,
the Count d’Artois, afterwards Charles the Tenth,
attempted to call him to order, as acting on subjects
not before the Assembly. “We are summoned,” said
Lafayette, “to make the truth known to his Majesty.
I must discharge my duty.” He proceeded, and here
you see how the great tragedy opened.</p>

<p>By formal propositions, sustained by well-considered
reasons, he called for: 1. Removal of Protestant disabilities,
and complete establishment of religious toleration;
2. Equality of imposts, and suppression of certain
unjust taxes; 3. Abolition of all arbitrary imprisonment,
and especially the odious <i>lettre-de-cachet</i>;
4. Revision of the criminal laws; 5. Economy in the
royal household, pensions, and all the departments of
government.</p>

<p>Following these moderate demands, he made a “motion,”&mdash;the
first time, it is said, this parliamentary
word, so suggestive of liberal discussion, was ever used
in France,&mdash;and this motion was for nothing less than
the convocation of a “National Assembly,”&mdash;uttering
here two other momentous words, which were then and
there for the first time pronounced. “What!” exclaimed
the Count d’Artois, “do you demand the States
General?” “Yes, and even more,” was the reply of
Lafayette.<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span></p>

<p>The States General were convened in May, 1789, at
Versailles, in the very shadow of that palace where in
latter years the kings and courtiers of the French monarchy
had lived like the gods of Olympus, and at once
this ancient body took the name of “National Assembly.”
Here appeared the imposing figure of Mirabeau,
demanding, in the name of the people, that the troops
should be removed. By his side was the yet youthful
Lafayette, seconding the demand, which he followed by
proposing a <i>Declaration of the Rights of Man</i>, embodying
not merely specific rights secured by precedent and
practice, as in the English Bill of Rights, but the Rights
of Man founded on Nature, and above all precedent or
practice. Such a statement was known in our country.
It constitutes part of the Declaration of Independence,
and also of the Constitution of Massachusetts, giving
character to each; but it was now for the first time
put forth in Europe, illustrating that “American Era”
which Lafayette constantly proclaimed. Its importance
was immense. It supplied a touchstone for all wrongs,
and elevated the hearts of the people. It began as
follows.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Nature has made men free and equal; the distinctions
necessary for social order are founded on general utility
only. Every man is born with rights inalienable and imprescriptible:
such are the liberty of his opinions; the care
of his honor and of his life; the right of property; the entire
disposal of his person, of his industry, of all his faculties;
the communication of his thoughts by all means possible;
the pursuit of happiness; and resistance to oppression.”<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a></p>

</div>

<p>In launching this Declaration, Lafayette vindicated
it as “recalling sentiments which Nature has engraved
on the heart of every one, but which take new force<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
when recognized by all; and this development,” he said,
“becomes the more interesting, since for a nation to love
Liberty it is sufficient that she knows it, and to be free
it is sufficient that she wills it.” He stated its further
value as “an expression of those truths from which all
institutions should spring, and by which the representatives
of the nation should be guided.”<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a></p>

<p>The Declaration of the Rights of Man, presented 11th
July, 1789, was a victory whose influence can never die.
It redounded immediately to the glory of Lafayette.
Lally-Tollendal, after declaring the ideas “grand and
majestic,” said that their author “speaks of Liberty as
he has already defended it.” These were words of sympathy.
Already the Archbishop of Sens had remarked
in the councils of the King, “Lafayette is the most
dangerous of antagonists, as his politics are all in action.”</p>

<p>A few days later, the Bastile, at once fortress and
prison, where for four hundred years the lawless will of
arbitrary power had buried its victims in a living tomb,
was levelled to the ground by the people of Paris, and
with it fell the ancient monarchy. Elated by success,
the people looked for a leader, and found him in the
author of the Declaration of the Rights of Man. Amidst
heartfelt applause Lafayette was placed at the head of
the embodied militia of the metropolis, which, under his
auspices, was organized as the National Guard. Thus
in a brief time two achievements were his,&mdash;first, the
introduction of a Declaration of the Rights of Man,
which he was foremost to present, and, secondly, the
organization of the National Guard, which was the
beginning of a citizen soldiery. Each was an event;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
the two together make an epoch.</p>

<p>Thus far champion of Liberty, it was now his part to
maintain order; and never was this work more conscientiously
pursued. The colors of Paris were <em>blue</em> and
<em>red</em>, but his spirit of conciliation was shown by adding
to them <em>white</em>, which was the ancient color of France,
out of these three forming that famous <em>tricolor</em>, which
he then proudly proclaimed was destined “to make the
tour of the world.” Strong in the popularity he had
won, he shrank from none of the responsibilities of his
perilous post, braving alike the multitude and the assassin,&mdash;unharmed
himself, treading calmly the burning
ploughshares of civil strife,&mdash;throwing over all the
shield of his protection, and by chivalrous intervention
at Versailles saving King and Queen from an infuriated
mob,&mdash;but always telling the King, that, if his Majesty
separated the royal cause from that of the people, he
should remain with the people: of all which there are
details written in blood.</p>

<p>Though engrossed by his post as Commander of the
National Guard, Lafayette did not neglect those other
duties as representative of the people. In the Assembly
he boldly proclaimed the right of resistance to tyranny,
saying, with sententious point, “Where Slavery prevails,
the most sacred of duties is insurrection.”<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> He
called for trial by jury,&mdash;liberty of worship,&mdash;the
rights of colored people in the colonies,&mdash;the suppression
of all privileges,&mdash;the abolition of the nobility
itself. To one who asked, how, after the abolition of
titles, they would replace the words “ennobled for having
saved the State on a particular day,” he answered,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
“Simply by declaring that on the day named the person
in question saved the State.” The proposition prevailed,
and from that time this sincere and upright citizen
laid down his own time-honored title, borne by his
family for successive generations, and was known only
as Lafayette. And otherwise he gave testimony by
example,&mdash;accepting the honorary command of the
National Guard formed by colored citizens of San Domingo,
although he refused this distinction from other
guards out of Paris, and entertaining colored men in
the uniform of the National Guard at his dinner-table,
where Clarkson, the English Abolitionist, met them in
1789.<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a></p>

<p>Beyond question, he was now the most exalted citizen
of France,&mdash;centre of all eyes, all hopes, and all fears,&mdash;holding
in his hand the destinies of King and people.
Rarely has such elevation been achieved; never
was such elevation so honestly won, and never was it
surrounded by responsibilities so appalling. Nothing
of office, honor, or power was beyond his reach, while
peril of all kinds lay in wait for him or sat openly in
his path. But he was indifferent alike to temptation
and to danger. Emoluments in whatsoever form he
rejected, saying that he attached no more importance
to the rejection than to the acceptance. Field-Marshal,
Grand-Constable, Lieutenant-General of the Kingdom,
Dictator even,&mdash;such were titles which he put aside.
Had his been a vulgar ambition, he might have clutched
at supreme power, and played the part of Cromwell or
Napoleon. But, true to the example of Washington,
and, above all, true to himself and those just sentiments<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
which belonged to his nature, he thought only of the
good of all. Calmly looking down upon the formless
chaos, where ancient landmarks were heaving in confused
mass, he sought to assuage the wide-spread tumult,
and to establish that divine tranquillity, which, like the
repose of Nature, is found only in harmony with law,
to the end that Human Rights, always sacred, should
have new force from the prevailing order. And this
done, it was his precious desire to withdraw into the
retirement of his home.</p>

<p>The Constitution, with its Declaration of the Rights
of Man, was at length proclaimed. Amidst unprecedented
pomp, in a vast field, the Campus Martius of
France, surrounded by delegates from all parts of the
country, and under the gaze of the anxious people gathered
in uncounted multitudes, the King, sitting upon
his throne, took the oath to support it. Lafayette, as
Major-General of the Federation, did the same,&mdash;while
National Guard and people, by voice and outstretched
hand, united in the oath. How faithfully he kept this
oath, true to the Constitution in all respects, upholding
each department in its powers, subduing violence,
watching the public peace, and for the sake of these
hazarding his good name with the people whose idol
he was,&mdash;all this belongs to the history of France.
Assured that the Revolution had accomplished its work,
he caused an amnesty to be proclaimed, and then deliberately
laid down his vast military power. Amidst the
gratulations of his countrymen and votes of honor, he
withdrew to the bosom of his family at the home of
his childhood. Unhappily, this was for a period very
brief.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span></p>
<p>The emigrant nobles, with two brothers of the King,
were gathering forces on the Rhenish frontier of France.
Austria and Prussia had joined in coalition for the same
hostile purpose. France was menaced; but its new
government hurled three armies to meet the invaders.
The army of the centre was placed under the command
of Lafayette. At the mention of his name in the Assembly
there was an outburst of applause, and when he
appeared at its bar, the President, addressing him, said,
“France will oppose to her enemies the Constitution
and Lafayette.” Little was then foreseen how soon
thereafter both were to fall.</p>

<p>A new influence was showing itself. Danton and
Robespierre were active. Clubs were organized, whose
daily meetings lashed the people to lawless frenzy. Extreme
counsels prevailed. Violence and outrage ensued.
The Jacobins, whose very name has become a
synonym for counsellors of sedition, were beginning to
be dominant. The Revolution was losing its original
character. The generous Lafayette, who had been its
representative and its glory, in whom its true grandeur
and humanity were all personified, revolted at
its excesses. From camp he addressed the National
Assembly, denouncing the Jacobins as substituting license
for liberty,&mdash;and then, supporting his letter, gallantly
appeared at the bar of the Assembly and repeated
his denunciation. But the Reign of Terror was lowering,
destined to fill France with darkness, and to send
a shudder through the world. After bloody conflict at
the gates of the palace, the King and his family were
driven to seek protection in the bosom of the Assembly.
The scaffold was not yet entirely ready. But the Constitution
was overturned, and with it Lafayette. Doubly
faithful, first to the oath he had taken, and then to his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
own supreme integrity, he denounced the audacious
crime. He was then at the head of his army; but
Jacobin hate had marked him as victim. Shrinking
from the horrors of civil contest, where success is purchased
only by the blood of fellow-citizens, he resolved&mdash;sad
alternative!&mdash;to withdraw from his post, and,
passing into neutral territory, seek the United States,
there from a distance to watch the storm which was
desolating his own unhappy country.</p>

<p>As his eminence was without precedent, so also was
his fall. Power, fortune, family, country, all were suddenly
changed for a dungeon, where, amidst cruel privations,
for more than five years, he wore away life. But
not in vain; for who can listen to the story of his captivity
without confessing new admiration for that sublime
fidelity to principle which illumined his dungeon?</p>

<p>With heart rent by anguish and darkened by the
gathering clouds, Lafayette, accompanied by a few friends,
left his army at Sedan. Traversing the frontier, in the
hope of reaching Holland, he fell into the hands of the
Royal Coalition; and then commenced the catalogue of
indignities and hardships under which his soul seemed
rather to rise than to bend. His application for a passport
was answered by the jeer that his passport would
be for the scaffold, while a mob of furious royalists
sought to anticipate the executioner. The King of
Prussia, hoping to profit from his increasing debility,
suggested that his situation would be improved in return
for information against France. The patriot was aroused
at this attempt on his character. “The King of Prussia
is very impertinent,” he replied, while composing himself
to the continued rigors which beset him. First immured
at Wesel on the Rhine, he was next transported<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
in a cart, by a long journey, to the far-famed Magdeburg,
whose secrets have been disclosed by Baron
Trenck, where for a year he was plunged in a damp
subterranean dungeon, closed by four successive doors,
all fastened by iron bolts, padlocks, and chains, when,
on the separate peace between Prussia and the French
Republic, he was handed over to Austrian jailers, by
whom he was transferred to Olmütz, an outlying fortress,
then little known, but now memorable in history,
on the eastern border of Austria, further east than the
old castle which witnessed the imprisonment of Richard
Cœur-de-Lion and the generous devotion of Blondel.
Here his captivity was complete. Alone in his cell,
with no object in sight except the four walls,&mdash;shut out
from all communication with the world,&mdash;shut out even
from all knowledge of his family, who on their part could
know nothing of him,&mdash;never addressed by name,&mdash;mentioned
in the bulletins of the prison only by his
number,&mdash;and, to cut off all possible escape by self-destruction,
deprived of knife and fork: such was now
his lot. If not a slave compelled to work without
wages, he was even a more wretched captive.</p>

<p>But never for one moment was his soul shaken in its
majestic fidelity; never was his example more lofty.
At the beginning, he was careful, by official declaration,
to make known his principles, so that he might
not be confounded with fugitive royalists. But his
prison cell was a constant testimony. Letters now exist,
written at peril of life, with toothpick dipped in soot
moistened with vinegar, where his wonderful nature
is laid bare.<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> Confessing his joy that he suffers from
that despotism which he combated, rather than from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
people he loved so well, he announces his equal hostility
to the committees of Jacobinism and the cabinet of
the Coalition,&mdash;declares his firm conviction, that, amidst
all the shocks of anarchy, Liberty will not perish,&mdash;remembers
with a thrill the anniversary of American
Independence, as that day comes round,&mdash;says of his
own Declaration of the Rights of Man, that, if he were
alone in the universe, he would not hesitate to maintain
it,<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> and repels with scorn every effort to vindicate him
at the expense of his well-known sentiments, declaring
that he would give his blood, drop by drop, to the people’s
cause, and that on the scaffold his first and last
words should be “Liberty and Equality,” while he
charges all the wrongs, all the crimes, all the perils,
all the sufferings of the Revolution upon the wretched
departure from these sacred principles.<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> His political
faith was grandly declared, when, addressing the Minister
of the United States at London, he calls down a
blessing upon our Republic, saying, “May <em>Liberty and
Equality</em>, with all the virtues truly republican, honest
industry, moderation, purity of manners, frankness and
liberality of spirit, obedience to the laws, firmness against
all usurpation, continue to prove that American Freedom
has its roots deep, not only in the head, but at
the bottom of the heart of its citizens! May public
prosperity, happiness of individuals, and federal concord
be a perpetual recompense to the United States,
and an example for other people!”<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> These words of
benediction, original as great, aptly define that “American
Era” which our hero had already hailed, while they
invoke upon our country all that virtuous heart could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
desire. But never did soul rise to purer heights than
when, at the beginning of his captivity, he bequeathed
this consoling truth as his legacy to mankind, that the
satisfaction from a single service rendered to Humanity
outweighs any suffering inflicted by enemies, or even by
the ingratitude of the people,<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a>&mdash;and then, as the dungeon
closed upon him, forgetting all that he was called
to undergo, his own personal afflictions and prolonged
captivity, he sends his thoughts to the poor slaves on
his distant plantation in Cayenne, whose emancipation
he had sought to accomplish. In the universal wreck
of his fortunes he knew not what had become of this
plantation, but he trusts that his wife “will take care
that the blacks who cultivate it shall preserve their
liberty.”<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> Search history, whether ancient or modern
pages, let Greece and Rome testify, but you can find
nothing more sublimely touching than this voice from
that heavy-bolted dungeon, serenely pleading for the
liberty of others far away. That noblest woman, mated
with him in soul as in marriage vow, had already exerted
herself to accomplish this purpose,&mdash;but, alas!
without effect. Cruelly was their liberty confiscated
with his estates.<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a></p>

<p>This confiscation, where Liberty itself disappeared,
was the terrible climax of that proscription which now
enveloped his friends and his family. In the prevailing
masquerade of blood the charge of <em>Fayettism</em> was
equivalent to a decree of death. Nor was tender woman
spared. The grandmother, the mother, and the sister<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
of his wife, all of the same ducal house, perished on
the scaffold. His wife was thrown into prison, and
escaped the same fate only by the timely overthrow of
Robespierre. Regaining liberty after a cruel imprisonment
of sixteen months, her maternal care was for her
son, George Washington Lafayette, still a boy, whom
she sent to his great namesake at Mount Vernon with
a letter from herself, and then, accompanied by her two
youthful daughters, with the protection of an American
passport, she makes her way across Germany to Vienna,
where she throws herself before the Imperial despot.
To her prayer for the release of her husband, he answers
that “his hands are tied”; but, moved by her
devotion, so womanly, so wifely, so heroic, he yields so
far as to consent that she, with her daughters, may share
his wretched captivity. Penetrating his dungeon, she
learned that the first change of raiment allowed him
was on her arrival, when the tattered rags which scarcely
covered his emaciated form were exchanged for a garb
of coarsest material,&mdash;an indulgence not accorded without
the insult of informing him that this had been
purposely sought, as with such alone was he worthy to
be clothed.<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> Three silver forks in her little inventory
were seized by the jailer, and this refined family during
a lingering imprisonment were driven to eat with
their fingers. These things are not to be forgotten, because,
while exhibiting the cruelty of despotic power,
against which the world now rises in judgment, they
show how his fidelity was tried, as also that of his family.
The wife, becoming ill, was refused permission to
leave the dungeon for medical advice at Vienna, except<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
on condition of not returning, when she beautifully
declared, for herself and her daughters, that they had
agreed to participate the rigors of his captivity, and
now repeated, with all their hearts, that they were
happier with him in the dungeon than they could be
anywhere else without him. Lafayette himself, when
tempted by offer of release on certain conditions or
promises, was stern as his jailer, and refused inexorably,&mdash;choosing
to suffer, sooner than compromise in any respect
his rights and duties as Frenchman or as American
citizen, which latter title he always claimed.</p>

<p>Vain, during this long period, was every effort for his
liberation. Not Fox, thundering in the British Parliament,&mdash;not
the gentler voice of Wilberforce, uniting
with Fox,&mdash;not Cornwallis, his old enemy at Yorktown,
personally pleading with the Emperor himself,<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a>&mdash;not
Washington, prompting our Ministers abroad and
writing directly to the Emperor, could open these prison
doors.<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> Lafayette was declared to be a representative
not only of the French Revolution, but of Universal
Enfranchisement, whose liberty was incompatible with
the safety of European governments: therefore must
he be immured in a dungeon. But private enterprise,
inspired by those generous promptings which are the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
glory of the human heart, for a moment seemed about
to prevail. This was before the arrival of his wife and
daughters. The health of the imprisoned champion
had suffered to such degree, that, under medical direction,
the rigors of confinement were relaxed so far as
to allow occasional exercise in the open air. Here was
an opportunity for which two friends, Bollmann, a German,
and Huger, an American, of South Carolina, had
watched for months, and they were able secretly to
apprise the captive of their plans. With their assistance,
after desperate conflict, in which his hand was
torn to the bone, he succeeded in disarming the guards,
and then enjoyed a gleam of liberty. It was a gleam
only. Helped on a horse by one of his devoted friends,
he started; but, ignorant of the way, and oppressed with
fatigue, wounded, bleeding, after a flight of twenty-four
hours, he was recaptured, brought back, and plunged
again into the worst torments of his dungeon. This
endeavor, though unsuccessful, is never read without
a gush of gratitude towards the courageous men, who,
taking life in hand, braved Austrian tyranny. Human
nature seems more beautiful from their example.<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a></p>

<p>All had now failed, and the dungeon seemed to have
closed upon Lafayette forever. The hearts of his friends
were wrung with anguish, and especially here in America.
Washington, at the fireside of Mount Vernon, shed
tears for his friend,&mdash;while to that noble wife, who
in all things was not less faithful than her heroic husband,
he addressed an earnest letter, regretting that he
had not words to convey his feelings, and placing a considerable
sum of money to her credit, which he mentioned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
as the least he was indebted for services, of which
he had never yet received an account.<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> But an intervention
was at hand which would not be denied. It was
the early sword of Napoleon Bonaparte, which, flashing
across the Alps from his Italian victories, broke open
the dungeon of Olmütz. Lafayette had been a captive
five years,&mdash;his wife and daughters shut up with him
twenty-two months. In the negotiations ending in the
Treaty of Campo Formio, it was required, under special
instructions from the French Directory, that he should
be released; and the conqueror was heard to say afterwards,
that, among all the sacrifices exacted of tottering
Austria, not one was so difficult to obtain. The captive
of many years, at last in the enjoyment of liberty,
hastened to Hamburg, where he found welcome with
the American consul.</p>

<p>This was in the autumn of 1797, and he was forty
years of age. But life with him, though brief in years,
had been extended by events full of lessons never to be
forgotten; above all was that great lesson of perpetual
fealty to Human Rights. And now this same lesson
was illustrated again. As in dungeon, so in exile, Lafayette
could not forget the cause to which his life was
devoted, especially the liberty of the African. From the
obscure retreat in Holstein, where he lingered, he addresses
Clarkson, the English Abolitionist, in eloquent
words, against the Slave-Trade, which was still the scandal
of nations, and announces that the mission of France,
while healing the wounds of the past, should be to assure
<em>Liberty for all, whether white or black</em>, under the
equal protection of Law.<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> Better far such mission than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
battle and conquest, which this ambitious nation craved.
In a letter to Washington at the same time he gives utterance
to his aspiration, that, for the good of the world,
the North and the South should gradually adopt the principles
on which the Independence and the Liberty of
the United States have been happily founded.<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> How
in thinking of himself Lafayette thought instinctively of
the slave appears in an incident of exile at this time.
In the straitened circumstances to which he was reduced,
stripped of the wealth to which he was born, poor and
homeless, his thoughts turned to the broad continent
across the Atlantic, and he conceived the plan of buying
a farm,&mdash;although without what he denominates
“the first dollar” necessary,&mdash;either in Virginia, not far
from what he calls the “Federal City,” or in New England,
not far from Boston,&mdash;and thus, in one of those
tender letters to his wife, he balances between these two
places. “I am aware, dear Adrienne,” he writes, under
date of 5th August, 1799, “that I, who complain of
the serfs of Holstein, as something very melancholy to
a friend of Liberty, should find in the valley of the
Shenandoah negro slaves; for Equality, which in the
Northern States is for everybody, exists in the Southern
States for the whites only. Therefore, while I perceive
all the reasons which should draw us to the neighborhood
of Mount Vernon and the seat of the Federal
Union, yet I should prefer New England.”<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> Never
more simply or conclusively was the special difference
between North and South presented for judgment.</p>

<p>Regaining his country at last, while the outlawry,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>though a dead letter, was not formally annulled, he
withdrew to the retirement of Lagrange, where, surrounded
by his family, he maintained unsullied the
integrity of his great character,&mdash;turning aside from
all temptation, and never for a moment swerving from
completest devotion to that cause for which he had
done and suffered so much. Others accepted office and
honor; he would not. Bonaparte wished to make him
Senator; Lafayette declined, as he afterwards declined
the Grand Cross of the Legion of Honor from the same
hand. Always himself, he touched the key-note of his
life, when, in a brief address to his fellow-citizens, on refusing
a post of dignity in 1802, he announced his hope
that the miracles of battle then surprising them might
be followed not only by peace abroad, but by domestic
tranquillity founded on the immutable principles
of Justice. At no moment is he more exemplary in
firmness than when on the proposition that Bonaparte
should be Consul for life he openly voted “No,” and
added, “I cannot vote for such a magistracy, until
Liberty has been sufficiently guarantied.”<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> In a noble
letter<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> he pleads with the successful warrior for the re-establishment
of Liberty, saying that all things combine
to fit him for this great work, which shall subdue danger
and calm distrust. Bonaparte did not hearken to
these words of patriot wisdom, but drove still further in
mad career. Lafayette, withdrawing yet more into the
repose of private life, avoided a contest, which he foresaw
must be futile, with a ruler having claims upon his
gratitude which he never ceased to acknowledge.</p>

<p>But it was not in his nature to despair. President
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>Jefferson urged him in 1804, after the acquisition of
Louisiana, to quit France, where the ground trembled
beneath his feet, and come to a land where he could
do so much good,&mdash;holding before him the governorship
of the new Territory, and declaring that his presence
alone would be better for its tranquillity than an
army of ten thousand men. But Lafayette avowed his
unwillingness to take a step that should seem to abandon
the destinies of his own country, duty to which
forbade him to despair of seeing established on the
foundation of a just and generous Liberty,&mdash;in one
word, American Liberty.<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a></p>

<p>While in retirement, he was visited by temptation in
yet another form, and again his fidelity shines forth. By
Act of Congress, repaying in part the accumulated debt
of the nation, he had become proprietor of a large territory
in Louisiana, to which in his reduced condition
he naturally looked for means. Persons familiar with
the country advised him to set up a manufacture of
tiles, promising from it, what he so much desired, “a
fixed revenue”; but he dismissed the proposition, as
“founded upon a purchased employment of thirty
slaves,”&mdash;“a thing,” said he, “<em>I detest</em>, and shall never
do”; and then, after expressing his wish that in letting
the land there should be “a first condition to employ
none but free hands, or, if negroes of New Orleans be
admitted, to stipulate their liberty in a short time,” he
proceeds to say, in memorable words: “I would not be
concerned in transactions in a negro country, <em>unless not
only my personal doings were unsullied with Slavery, but
I had provided with others to render the very spot productive
of Freedom</em>.”<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> This was in 1805, before the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
Slave-Trade was yet abolished, and when Slavery was
just beginning its fatal empire over our Republic. But
it was only part of that faithful testimony which he
bore so constantly.</p>

<p>Such a character was a perpetual protest, and Napoleon
in the pride of colossal power confessed it. Son and
son-in-law, though distinguished, could not obtain promotion,&mdash;the
Emperor himself on one occasion erasing
their names, with the tyrannical ejaculation, “These
Lafayettes cross my path everywhere.” The true reason
was disclosed, when, at another time, he said: “Lafayette
alone in France holds fast to his original ideas of
Liberty. Though tranquil now, he will reappear, if occasion
offers.” Stronger homage to absolute fidelity could
not be. He was tranquil, through all the splendid
agony of the Empire, its marvellous conquests and its
tremendous disasters,&mdash;tranquil at the victories of Austerlitz,
Jena, Friedland, and Wagram, at the retreat
from Moscow, at the stunning news from Leipsic, at
the capitulation of Paris. As little could he participate
in the restoration of Louis as in the usurpation of
Napoleon. At last he reappeared. It was on the return
from Elba, hazarding that peace purchased at such
sacrifice, when, by characteristic action in harmony
with his whole career, his present was linked with his
past, and the chief of the Great Revolution, declining
again the honors of the Senate and the title of Count,
declaring, that, if ever again he entered public life, it
must be as representative of the people, came forward
as simple deputy, and then at an early day, with happy
phrase, rallied the Chamber to an attitude of independence
which should decide “whether it would be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
called a national representation or a Napoleon club.”
The disaster of Waterloo hastened the impending crisis.
The Emperor menaced a dissolution of the Chamber and
a dictatorship. The time had come for the hero of Liberty.
He spoke, and with a voice that had been silent
for a generation bravely recalled the sacred cause of
which he was the veteran, and that tri-color flag which
was the symbol of Liberty, Equality, and Public Order.
On his motion the Chamber declared itself permanent,
and any attempt to dissolve it treason; and then, while
vindicating France against the imputation of fickleness
towards Napoleon, whom it had followed over uncounted
fields, from the sands of Egypt to the snows of Russia,
the Defender of Liberty insisted upon his abdication.
Yet, true always to every just sentiment of gratitude
and humanity, he scorned the idea of surrendering the
fallen man to the Allies, saying he was “astonished that
such a proposition should be addressed to a prisoner of
Olmütz,”<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> and he sought to provide means for escape
to America, showing him every consideration consistent
with duty to the country.</p>

<p>The fall of Napoleon was followed by the restoration
of the Bourbons to the throne of France, lasting from
1815 to 1830, and during much of this period Lafayette,
released from all constraint, was member of the
Chamber of Deputies. The King, who in early life
had known him personally, trembled at his election.
As he entered the Chamber for the first time, every eye
turned to him, and every tongue pronounced his name
with admiration, hope, or fear; nor was any member
observed afterwards with equal interest. He took his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
seat on the extreme left, and always kept it. His attendance
was marked by that fidelity which belonged
to his nature; nor did advancing years or any disgust
interfere with the constant and unwearied discharge of
his parliamentary duties. Here, as everywhere, he was
open, sincere, and brave. Overtopping others in character,
he was conspicuous also in debate. Though not
a rhetorician, he spoke with ease and effect, while every
word had the inspiration of noble ideas, often expressed
with sententious force. Especially was he moved whenever
Liberty came in question; nor did the disasters
falling upon him and his house, or any other consideration,
make him hesitate to vindicate the Revolution,
alike in substantial results and in principles. “Notwithstanding,”
he said, “all that was afterwards lost
through anarchy, terrorism, bankruptcy, and civil war,
in spite of a terrible struggle against all Europe, there
remains the incontestable truth, that agriculture, industry,
public instruction, the comfort and independence of
three quarters of the population, and the public morals,
have been improved to a degree of which there is no
example in any equal period of history, or in any other
part of the Old World.”<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> With brilliant effect he portrayed
the wrongs and abuses which disappeared before
what he liked to call “the flag of Liberty, Equality, and
Public Order.”<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> And he attributed the evils of France
less to the madness of violence than to compromise of
conscience by timid men. In the same lofty spirit he
denounced the Holy Alliance as “a vast and powerful
league whose object was to enslave and brutify mankind.”<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a>
By such utterances were the people schooled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
and elevated. The inspiration which was his own inner
light he imparted to others.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>His parliamentary career was interrupted by an episode
which belongs to the poetry of history. On the
unanimous invitation of the Congress of the United
States, he again visited the land whose Independence
he helped to secure. This was in 1824. Forty years
had passed since he was last here. But throughout this
long period of a life transcendent in activity and privations,
as well as in fame, he had ever turned with fondness
to the scene of his early consecration, and proudly
avowed himself American in heart and American in
principle. His early compeers were all numbered with
the dead, and he remained sole survivor among the
generals of Washington. But the people had multiplied,
and the country had grown in wealth and power.
All rose to meet his coming, and he was welcomed
everywhere as the Nation’s guest. To the inquiry, on
his landing at New York, how he would be addressed,
he replied, “As an American General,”&mdash;thus discarding
again the title of his birth. From beginning to end,
men and women, young and old, official bodies, towns,
cities, States, Congress, all vied in testimonies of devotion
and gratitude, while the children of the schools,
boys and maidens, swelled the incomparable holiday,
which, stretching from North to South, and covering
the whole country, absorbed for the time every difference,
and made all feel as children of one household.
The strong and universal sentiment found expression in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
familiar words, repeated everywhere:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“We bow not the neck,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">We bend not the knee,</div>
<div class="verse">But our hearts, Lafayette,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">We surrender to thee.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">It belongs to the glory of Lafayette that he inspired
this sentiment, and it belongs to the glory of our country
to have felt it. As there was never such a guest,
so was there never such a host. They were alike without
parallel. But amidst this grandest hospitality, binding
him by new ties, he kept the loyalty of his heart:
he did not forget the African slave.<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a></p>

<p>The visit was full of memorable incidents, sometimes
most touching, among which I select a scene little
known. At one of those receptions occurring wherever
the national guest appeared, a veteran of the Revolution,
in his original Continental uniform, with the addition
of a small blanket, or rather piece of blanket,
upon the shoulders, and with his ancient musket, that
had seen service on many fields, came forward. Drawing
himself up in the stiff manner of the old-fashioned
drill, he made a military salute, which Lafayette returned
with affection, tears starting to his eyes,&mdash;for
he remembered well that uniform, and saw that an old
soldier, more venerable than himself in years, stood before
him. “Do you know me?” said the soldier,&mdash;for
the manner of the General persuaded him that <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>he was
personally remembered, although nearly fifty years had
passed since their service together. “Indeed, I cannot
remember you,” the General replied frankly. “Do you
remember the frosts and snows of Valley Forge?” “I
can never forget them,” said Lafayette. The veteran
then related, that, one freezing night, as the General went
his rounds, he came upon a sentry thinly clad, with
shoes of raw cowhide and without stockings, about to
perish with cold; that he took the musket of the sentry,
saying to him, “Go to my hut; you will find stockings
there, and a blanket, which, after warming yourself, you
will bring here; meanwhile give me your musket, and I
will keep guard.” “I obeyed,” the veteran continued,
“and returning to my post refreshed, you cut the blanket
in two, retaining one half and giving me the other.
Here, General, is that half, and I am the sentry whose
life you saved.” Saint Martin dividing his cloak is a
kindred story of the Church, portrayed by the genius of
Vandyck.<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> Lafayette, at the date of his charity, was
younger even than the Saint, and the act was not less
saintly. But this is only an instance of the gratitude
he met. By such tribute, in accord with the universal
popular heart, was the triumph of our benefactor carried
beyond that of any Roman ascending the Capitol with
the spoils of war.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>And this might have been the crown even of his exalted
life. But at home in France there was yet further
need of him. In the madness of tyranny, Charles the
Tenth undertook by arbitrary ordinance to trample on
popular rights, and to subvert the Charter under which
he held his throne. The people were aroused. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
streets of Paris were filled with barricades. France was
heaving as in other days. Then turned all eyes to the
patriarch of Lagrange, who, already hero of two revolutions,
commanded confidence alike by his principles and
his bravery. Summoned from his country home, he
repaired to Paris, imparting instant character to the
movement. With a few devoted friends about him,&mdash;one
of whom is a dear and honored friend of my own,
Dr. Howe, of Boston,&mdash;this venerable citizen, seventy-three
years of age, exposed to all the perils of the conflict
hotly raging in the streets between the people and
the troops, was conducted on foot across barricades to
the Hôtel de Ville, and once more placed at the head
of the National Guard. “Liberty shall triumph,” said
the veteran, “or we will all perish together.”<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> Charles
the Tenth ceased to reign, and the Revolution of 1830
was accomplished. The fortunes of France were now
in the hands of Lafayette. He was again what Madame
de Staël had called him at an earlier day, master of
events. It rested with him to choose. He might have
made a Republic, of which he would have been acknowledged
head. But, cautious of Public Order, which
with him was next to Liberty, mindful of that moderation
which he had always cultivated, and unwilling,
if Liberty were safe, to provoke a civil contest, drenching
France again in fraternal blood, he proposed “a popular
throne surrounded by republican institutions,” and
the Duke of Orléans, under the name of Louis Philippe,
became king. Clearly his own preference was for a
Republic on the American model, but he yielded this
cherished idea, satisfied that at last Liberty had prevailed,
while peace was assured to his blood-stained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
country. If the republican throne fell short of his just
expectations, it was because, against high injunction, he
had put trust in princes.</p>

<p>The loftiness of his character was revealed, when, at
a menace of violence by the excited populace, he issued
a general order, as commander of the National Guard,
announcing himself as “the man of Liberty and Public
Order, loving popularity far more than life, but determined
to sacrifice both rather than fail in any duty and
tolerate a crime,&mdash;persuaded that no end justifies means
which public or private morals disown.”<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a></p>

<p>Soon again he laid down his great command, contenting
himself with his farm and his duties as deputy. But
his heart went wherever Liberty was struggling,&mdash;now
with the Pole, and then with the African slave. To the
rights of the latter he had borne true and unfaltering
loyalty at all times and in all places, beginning with
that memorable appeal to Washington on the consummation
of Independence, and repeated in two triumphal
visits to our country,&mdash;also in public debate, in conversation,
in correspondence,&mdash;in the interesting experiment
at Cayenne, and, more affecting still, in the dungeon
of arbitrary power. Every slave, according to him,
has a natural right to immediate emancipation, whether
by concession or force; and this principle he declared
above all question.<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> He knew no distinction of color,
as he continually showed. His first letter to President
John Quincy Adams, after return from his American
triumph, mentions that he had dined in the company
of two commissioners from Hayti, one a mulatto and
the other entirely black, and he was “well pleased<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span> with
their good sense and good manners.”<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> Tenderly he
touched this great question in our own country; but
his constancy in this respect shows how it haunted and
perplexed him, like a Sphinx with a perpetual riddle.
He could not understand how men who had fought for
their own liberty could deny liberty to others. But
he did not despair, although, on one occasion, when this
inconsistency glared upon him, his impatient philanthropy
exclaimed, that he would never have drawn his
sword for America, had he known that it was to found
a government sanctioning Slavery.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The time had come for this great life to close. A
sudden illness, contracted in following on foot the funeral
of a colleague, confined him to his bed. As his
case became critical, the Chamber of Deputies, by solemn
vote,&mdash;perhaps without example in parliamentary history,&mdash;directed
their President to inquire of George
Washington Lafayette after the health of his illustrious
parent. On the following day, May 20, 1834, he died,
aged seventy-seven.</p>

<p>The ruling passion of his life was strong to the
close. As at the beginning, so at the end, he was all
for Human Rights. This ruled his mind and filled his
heart. His last public speech was in behalf of political
refugees seeking shelter in France from the proscription
of arbitrary power.<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a> The last lines traced by
his hand, even after the beginning of his fatal illness,
attest his joy at that great act of Emancipation by
which England had just given freedom to her slaves.
“Nobly,” he wrote, “has the public treasure been
employed!”<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> And these last words still resound in our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
ears, speaking from his tomb.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Such was Lafayette. At the tidings of his death,
there was mourning in two hemispheres, and the saying
of Pericles seemed to be accomplished, that “To the
illustrious the whole earth is a sepulchre.”<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> It was felt
that one had gone whose place was among the great
names of history, combining the double fame of hero
and martyr, heightened by the tenderness of personal
attachment and gratitude. Nor could such example
belong to France or America only. Living for all, his
renown became the common property of the whole Human
Family. The words of the poet were revived:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Ne’er to these chambers where the mighty rest</div>
<div class="verse">Since their foundation came a nobler guest;</div>
<div class="verse">Nor e’er was to the bowers of bliss conveyed</div>
<div class="verse">A fairer spirit or more welcome shade.”<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Judge him by the simple record of his life, and you
will confess his greatness. Judge him by the motives
of his conduct, and you will bend with reverence before
him. More than any other man in history he is the
impersonation of Liberty. His face is radiant with its
glory, as his heart was filled with its sweetness. His
was that new order of greatness destined soon to displace
the old. Peculiar and original, he was without predecessors.
Many will come after him, but there were none
before him. He was founder, inventor, poet, as much
as if he had built a city, discovered ether, or composed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
an epic. On his foundation all mankind will build;
through his discovery all will be aided; by his epic all
will be uplifted. Early and intuitively he saw man as
brother, and recognized the equal rights of all. Especially
was he precocious in asserting the equal rights of
the African slave. His supreme devotion to Humanity
against all obstacles was ennobled by that divine constancy
and uprightness which from youth’s spring to the
winter of venerable years made him always the same,&mdash;in
youth showing the firmness of age, and in age showing
the ardor of youth,&mdash;ever steady when others were
fickle, ever faithful when others were false,&mdash;holding
cheap all that birth, wealth, or power could bestow,&mdash;renouncing
even the favor of fellow-citizens, which he
loved so well,&mdash;content with virtue as his only nobility,&mdash;and
whether placed on the dazzling heights of worldly
ambition or plunged in the depths of a dungeon, always
true to the same great principles, and making even
the dungeon witness of his unequalled fidelity.</p>

<p>By the side of such sublime virtue what were his
eminent French contemporaries? What was Mirabeau,
with life sullied by impurity and dishonored by a bribe?
What was Talleyrand, with heartless talent devoted to
his personal success? What was Robespierre, with impracticable
endeavors baptized in blood? What was
Napoleon himself, whose surpassing powers to fix fortune
by profound combinations, or to seize it with irresistible
arm, were debased by the brutality of selfishness?
These are the four chief characters of the Revolution,
already dropping from the firmament as men
learn to appreciate those principles by which Humanity
is advanced. Lafayette ascends as they disappear, while
the world hails that Universal Enfranchisement which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
he served so well. As the mighty triumph is achieved,
which he clearly foresaw, immense will be his reward
among men.</p>

<p>Great he was, indeed,&mdash;not as author, although he
has written what we are glad to read,&mdash;not as orator,
although he has spoken much and well,&mdash;not as soldier,
although he displayed both bravery and military
genius,&mdash;not even as statesman, versed in the science
of government, although he saw instinctively the relations
of men to government. Nor did his sympathetic
nature possess the power always to curb the passions of
men, or to hurl the bolts by which wickedness is driven
back. Not on these accounts is he great. Call him less
a force than an influence, less “king of men” than
servant of Humanity,&mdash;his name is destined to be a
spell beyond that of any king, while it shines aloft like
a star. Great he is as one of earth’s benefactors, possessing
in largest measure that best gift from God to
man, the genius of beneficence sustained to the last by
perfect honesty; great, too, he is as an early, constant
Republican, who saw the beauty and practicability of
Republican Institutions as the expression of a true civilization,
and upheld them always; and great he is as
example, which, so long as history endures, must inspire
author, orator, soldier, and statesman all alike to
labor, and, if need be, to suffer for Human Rights. The
fame of such a character, brightening with the Progress
of Humanity, can be measured only by the limits of a
world’s gratitude and the bounds of time.</p>

<h3>APPENDIX.</h3>

<div class="figcenter">

</div>

<div class="medium">

<p>An incident in connection with the delivery of this address at Philadelphia
illustrates the sensitive condition of the public mind at the
time. Mr. Sumner was announced to give it before “The People’s Literary
Institute,” when he received a letter from the President of the
Institute, which will be understood by his reply.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="right medium">“<span class="smcap">Senate Chamber</span>, December 19, 1860.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I have been honored by your official communication as
President of the People’s Literary Institute of Philadelphia, bearing date
17th December, in which you say, ‘that the patrons of the Institute are
persons of all shades of political opinion, and that in the present excited state
of the public mind it is desirable that Slavery and Antislavery should not be
touched by its lecturers.’ This is written to govern me on the evening of
the 27th of December, when, according to invitation, I was to address the
Institute.</p>

<p>“With much misgiving I accepted the place urged upon me in your
course. For some time I declined it, and yielded only to the most pressing
solicitation. Afterwards, in reply to an inquiry from one of your officers, I
let it be known that my subject would be ‘Lafayette,’ and I think you
have already announced the same in your course. You are too familiar
with the career of this constant friend of Human Freedom not to know that
it cannot be adequately presented without touching upon the topics which
you forbid. It was the peculiar glory of this illustrious man, that from his
early days to his death-bed he strove always for Human Freedom, and
especially sought to remove the intolerable evil of African Slavery. To leave
so great a part of his life untouched would be an infidelity I cannot commit.
Indeed, I do not think your careful judgment could approve such an
act. If at any other time it might be done, you will see that at this moment,
when persons acting in behalf of Slavery openly threaten <em>treason</em>,
silence upon testimony so powerful would be nearly akin to complicity with
the treason. The pirates of the Caribbean Sea are said to have carefully
recited the Ten Commandments, omitting ‘Thou shalt not steal.’ A precedent
like this I have no disposition to follow.</p>

<p>“Even if the subject of my lecture did not require me to infringe your instructions,
I beg to assure you that I could not consent to speak under any
such constraint. For many years I have addressed associations, societies,
and meetings of all kinds; but never before have I been met by any hint of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>interference with the completest latitude of speech, according to my sense
of the duties and proprieties of the occasion. Long accustomed to free
speech, I am too old now to renounce it.</p>

<p>“There are two recent events in Philadelphia which furnish a commentary
upon your letter. The first is a resolution adopted at a public meeting,
with the Mayor in the chair, openly proclaiming that free speech must not
be permitted at the North; and the other is a practical illustration of this
tyranny in the refusal to hear the accomplished Mr. Curtis, when announced
to lecture before your Institute on ‘The Policy of Honesty.’ All this is done
for the sake of Slavery, and in the hope of soothing traitors. You can
know little of me, if you suppose that I can take part in any such work.
Of course my place in your list is now vacant.</p>

<p>“I observe that your letter, although signed officially as President of the
People’s Institute, is marked ‘<i>Confidential</i>.’ I have no desire to draw your
name into any public discussion; but it is obvious that my refusal to take
part in your course cannot be frankly stated without reference to what you
have written.</p>

<p>“I have the honor to be, dear Sir,</p>

<p class="sig">“Your obedient servant,</p>

<p class="sig2">“<span class="smcap">Charles Sumner</span>.</p>

<p class="noindent medium">“&mdash;&mdash; &mdash;&mdash;,<br />
“President of the People’s Literary Institute, Philadelphia.”</p>

</div>

<p>December 22, Mr. Sumner received from the President of the Institute
the following telegram:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Permit me to withdraw my letter. Come and speak freely. Do not
decline. I have written you to-day.”</p>

</div>

<p>This was followed by a letter from the President, repeating his request,
and saying, among other things,&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“That the public are very desirous to hear you, and will be greatly disappointed,
if you cancel the engagement.</p>

<p>“That, in common with the Managers and patrons of the Institute, I
earnestly hope that you will reconsider your determination not to speak on
the 27th instant, and that you will consent to deliver the lecture on ‘Lafayette,’
which has been advertised, and which the people expect, without
any feeling of constraint as to the treatment of the subject.”</p>

</div>

<p>Accordingly, December 27, Mr. Sumner spoke for the first time in
Philadelphia. A few sentences from the <i>Press</i> show how he was received.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The announcement that Hon. Charles Sumner would lecture at Concert
Hall, before the People’s Literary Institute, last evening, attracted an immense
audience. At an early hour the hall was filled to its utmost sitting
and standing capacity, and there must have been enough turned away, after
the sale of tickets was discontinued at the door, to have filled another hall
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>of equal size. The audience was also of the most respectable character.…</p>

<p>“When the lecturer entered the platform, he was greeted with uproarious
applause. For several minutes the audience&mdash;the greater part of whom
rose to receive him&mdash;continued clapping, cheering, and waving their handkerchiefs.…</p>

<p>“He was introduced to the audience by President Allen, of Girard College,
who said that the scholar, the eloquent orator, and the steadfast friend
of man, all found a synonym in the name of the statesman who was now to
address them; and his subject was suggestive to all lovers of Liberty. He
had now the pleasure of introducing the Hon. Charles Sumner, who was to
speak on Lafayette. The lecture which followed occupied two hours and a
quarter in its delivery, and was given without notes.”</p>

</div>

<p>The address on Lafayette was the last of a series during the year,
by which Mr. Sumner had striven to direct public opinion against
Slavery, so at least that it should not be carried into the Territories.
Amidst hostile criticism there were friendly expressions, showing that
he had not spoken in vain. Of these, one is presented as applicable to
the series. It is the Dedication of the Thanksgiving Sermon, Sunday
Evening, November 11, 1860, by Rev. Gilbert Haven, entitled, “The
Cause and Consequence of the Election of Abraham Lincoln.”</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="center">“TO THE HON. CHARLES SUMNER:</p>

<p>“Who has spoken the bravest words for Liberty in the most perilous
places; who has suffered in behalf of the Slave only less than those who
wear the martyr’s crown; who has come forth from that suffering with the
profoundest, because experimental, sympathy with the Oppressed, with a
more intense hatred of the Oppression, yet without any bitterness of heart
against the Oppressor; who will stand forth in the future times as the clearest-eyed,
boldest-tongued, and purest-hearted Statesman of the age: these
few words of Thanksgiving and Praise, for the manifestation of the Presence
and Power of the <span class="smcap">Almighty Redeemer</span> in this greatest work of our time,
are most respectfully dedicated.”</p>

<div class="figcenter">

</div>

<div class="medium">

<p>The opening of Congress was signalized by two things: first, the
Message of President Buchanan, December 4, 1860, misrepresenting
the North, and practically abdicating the power to control rebellious
States; and, secondly, the development of a determination on the part
of certain States at the South to secede from the Union. Here South
Carolina took the lead.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In the Senate, December 6th, Mr. Powell, of Kentucky, brought forward
a resolution, which, after modification by himself, was as follows.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<i>Resolved</i>, That so much of the President’s Message as relates to the present
agitated and distracted condition of the country, and the grievances between
the slaveholding and the non-slaveholding States, be referred to a
special committee of thirteen members, and that said committee be instructed
to inquire into the present condition of the country and report by
bill or otherwise.”</p>

</div>

<p>In the consideration of this resolution a debate ensued on the state
of the Union, and the resolution was adopted December 18th. The
committee appointed by the Vice-President, Mr. Breckinridge, was
Mr. Powell of Kentucky, the mover, Mr. Hunter of Virginia, Mr.
Crittenden of Kentucky, Mr. Seward of New York, Mr. Toombs of
Georgia, Mr. Douglas of Illinois, Mr. Collamer of Vermont, Mr. Jefferson
Davis of Mississippi, Mr. Wade of Ohio, Mr. Bigler of Pennsylvania,
Mr. Rice of Minnesota, Mr. Doolittle of Wisconsin, and Mr.
Grimes of Iowa. December 31st, Mr. Powell reported to the Senate
“that the Committee have not been able to agree upon any general plan
of adjustment.” In the propositions offered in committee by Mr.
Douglas we first meet that for the disfranchisement of the colored race,
even where already voters, which was part of the Crittenden Compromise
in its final form.<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span></p>

<p>Immediately after the first reading of Mr. Powell’s resolution for the
appointment of a committee Mr. Sumner spoke as follows.</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">MR. PRESIDENT,&mdash;I have no desire to make a
speech at this time, nor to take any part in the
discussion that has commenced. I can bear yet a little
longer the misrepresentations in the President’s Message,
and I believe the North can bear them yet a little
longer. The time will come, perhaps, when I shall
deem it my duty to set forth those things in the light
of reason and of history; meanwhile I content myself
with simply offering to the Senate testimony of direct
and most authoritative bearing upon the present state
of the Union. If I may adopt the language of the
Senator from Mississippi [Mr. <span class="smcap">Jefferson Davis</span>], it will
help us to make the diagnosis of the present disease in
the body politic.</p>

<p>I hold in my hand an unpublished autograph letter,
written by General Jackson while President of the
United States, and addressed to a clergyman in a slaveholding
State. Omitting certain sentences which are
of a purely private nature, the letter is as follows.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent medium" style="float: left;">“[<i>Private.</i>]</p>

will only be remembered by the people to be execrated for
their wicked designs to sever and destroy the only good
government on the globe, and that prosperity and happiness
we enjoy over every other portion of the world.
Haman’s gallows ought to be the fate of all such ambitious
men, who would involve their country in civil war, and all
the evils in its train, that they might reign and ride on its
whirlwinds and direct the storm. The free people of these
United States have spoken, and consigned these wicked

Nullifiers; you have them among you; let them meet with

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“known, was a mere pretext. Its burden was on your
coarse woollens. By the law of July, 1832, coarse woollen
was reduced to five per cent for the benefit of the South.
Mr. Clay’s bill takes it up and classes it with woollens at
fifty per cent, reduces it gradually down to twenty per cent,
and there it is to remain, and Mr. Calhoun and all the Nullifiers
agree to the principle. The cash duties and home
valuation will be equal to fifteen per cent more, and after
the year 1842 you pay on coarse woollens thirty-five per cent.
If this is not protection, I cannot understand; therefore the
Tariff was only the pretext, and Disunion and a Southern
Confederacy the real object. The next pretext will be the
Negro or Slavery Question.</p>

me kindly to your lady and family, and believe me to

<p>Here is the original autograph letter, in the well-known,
unmistakable, bold, broad handwriting. [<i>Here
Mr. Sumner held the letter up.</i>] These are the words
of a patriot slaveholder of Tennessee, addressed to a
patriot clergyman of a slaveholding State, and they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
are directly applicable to the present hour. Of practical
sense, of inflexible purpose, and of various experience,
Andrew Jackson saw intuitively the springs and
motives of human conduct, while he loved his country
with a firm and all-embracing attachment. Thus inspired,
he was able to judge the present and to discern
the future. The Tariff, in his opinion, was a pretext
only,&mdash;Disunion and a Southern Confederacy the real
object. “The next pretext,” says he,&mdash;and you, Sir,
cannot fail to mark the words,&mdash;“will be the Negro
or Slavery Question.” These, Sir, are his words, not
mine. Such is his emphatic judgment. Words and
judgment now belong to history; nor can they be assailed
without assailing one of the greatest examples
that a slaveholding community has given to our common
country.</p>

PROPOSITIONS.</h2>

<p class="plabeln"><span class="smcap">Incidents and Notes, December 18, 1860, to March 4, 1861.</span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/line.png" width="80" height="16" alt="" />
</div>

<div class="medium">

<p>Before the organization of the Committee of Thirteen
on the State of the Union, mentioned in the
preceding article, Mr. Crittenden brought forward a
joint resolution, December 18, 1860, containing propositions
of Compromise, which soon became known by
the name of their author. These propositions were
extensive in character, covering amendments to the
Constitution and recommendations to the States. Afterwards,
January 3, 1861, he reintroduced his propositions,
with a new preamble, and with two additional
amendments to the Constitution. That such propositions
could have been seriously presented as a basis
of Union shows the exacting spirit of Slavery, and the
deplorable insensibility to great principles.</p>

<p>The Compromise in its final form opened with a Constitutional
prohibition of Slavery in all territory of the
United States north of 36° 30´, but on the other hand it
was expressly declared that “in all the territory now
held, or hereafter to be acquired, south of said line of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
latitude, <em>Slavery of the African race is hereby recognized
as existing</em>, and shall not be interfered with by Congress,
but shall be protected as property by all the departments
of the Territorial Government during its continuance”;
and any territory north or south of this line was
to be admitted into the Union as a State with or without
Slavery, as the Constitution of such new State might
provide. It was further declared that Congress should
have no power to abolish Slavery in places under its
exclusive jurisdiction and within the limits of slaveholding
States; that Congress should have no power to
abolish Slavery in the District of Columbia, so long as
it exists in the adjoining States of Virginia and Maryland,
or either, nor without the consent of the inhabitants,
nor without just compensation to slave-owners
who do not consent to such abolishment; that Congress
should not prohibit officers of the Federal [National]
Government, or Members of Congress, whose duties
require them to be in the District, from bringing with
them their slaves and holding them as such; and that
Congress should have no power to prohibit or hinder the
transportation of slaves from one State to another, or to
a Territory in which slaves are by law permitted to be
held, whether that transportation be by land, navigable
rivers, or by sea.</p>

<p>Then followed Constitutional amendments, providing
that the United States should pay to the owner of a
fugitive slave the full value of such slave, in case of obstruction
to the recovery thereof,&mdash;also providing that
no future amendment of the Constitution should affect
these articles, or the existing provisions relating to slave
representation and the surrender of fugitives from service,
or give to Congress any power to abolish or interfere
with Slavery in any of the States where it exists.</p>

<p>Then followed another Constitutional amendment,
providing that “the elective franchise and the right
to hold office, whether Federal [National], State, Territorial,
or municipal, shall not be exercised by persons<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
who are in whole or in part of the African race,”&mdash;and
still another, providing for the acquisition of “districts
of country in Africa and South America” for the colonization
of “free negroes and mulattoes.”<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a></p>

<p>Besides these amendments to the Constitution, the
joint resolution, in order “to remove all just cause for
the popular discontent and agitation which now disturb
the peace of the country and threaten the stability of
its institutions,” proceeded to declare, that the laws now
in force for the recovery of fugitive slaves are in strict
pursuance of the plain and mandatory provisions of the
Constitution, that the slaveholding States are entitled
to their faithful observance and execution, and that
laws should be made for the punishment of those who
illegally interfere to prevent their execution,&mdash;that
State laws interfering with the recovery of fugitive
slaves (referring to Personal Liberty Laws) should be
repealed, that the Fugitive Slave Act of September
18, 1850, should be amended in certain particulars, and
that the laws for the suppression of the African Slave-Trade
should be made effectual.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>

<p>The Crittenden Compromise was encountered in the
Senate by the following counter propositions, offered by
Mr. Clark, of New Hampshire, January 9, 1861.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<i>Resolved</i>, That the provisions of the Constitution are
ample for the preservation of the Union and the protection
of all the material interests of the country; that it
needs to be obeyed rather than amended; and that an extrication
from the present dangers is to be looked for in strenuous
efforts to preserve the peace, protect the public property,
and enforce the laws, rather than in new guaranties
for particular interests, compromises for particular difficulties,
or concessions to unreasonable demands.</p>

<p>“<i>Resolved</i>, That all attempts to dissolve the present
Union, or overthrow or abandon the present Constitution,
with the hope or expectation of constructing a new one, are
dangerous, illusory, and destructive; that in the opinion of
the Senate of the United States no such reconstruction is
practicable; and therefore to the maintenance of the existing
Union and Constitution should be directed all the energies
of all the departments of the Government, and the efforts
of all good citizens.”</p>

</div>

<p>January 16, the question being taken by yeas and
nays, on the motion to substitute, resulted, yeas 25,
nays 23, as follows.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><i>Yeas</i>,&mdash;Messrs. Anthony, Baker, Bingham, Cameron,
Chandler, Clark, Collamer, Dixon, Doolittle, Durkee, Fessenden,
Foot, Foster, Grimes, Hall, Harlan, King, Seward,
Simmons, Sumner, Ten Eyck, Trumbull, Wade, Wilkinson,
Wilson,&mdash;25.</p>

<p><i>Nays</i>,&mdash;Messrs. Bayard, Bigler, Bragg, Bright, Clingman,
Crittenden, Fitch, Green, Gwin, Hunter, Johnson of
Tennessee, Kennedy, Lane, Latham, Mason, Nicholson, Pearce,
Polk, Powell, Pugh, Rice, Saulsbury, Sebastian,&mdash;23.</p>

</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span></p>
<p>So the amendment was agreed to, and the proposition
of Mr. Clark was substituted for that of Mr. Crittenden.</p>

<p>This important result, by which the Crittenden Compromise
received a heavy blow, was a surprise, brought
about by the Senators of the Gulf States,&mdash;Iverson of
Georgia, Clay and Fitzpatrick of Alabama, Brown and
Jefferson Davis of Mississippi, Benjamin and Slidell of
Louisiana, Mallory and Yulee of Florida, Hemphill and
Wigfall of Texas, and Johnson of Arkansas,&mdash;who were
in attendance, but withheld their votes. The two Senators
of South Carolina, Hammond and Chesnut, also
Toombs of Georgia, had not appeared in their seats
during the session. Three of these Senators voting
against the substitute, it could not have been carried,
and the original propositions would have been still before
the Senate. The adoption of the substitute was
used by them to inflame their constituents. Their conduct
on this occasion showed a “foregone conclusion.”
Nothing but Disunion would satisfy them,&mdash;not even
the Crittenden Compromise, so full of surrender.</p>

<p>Then ensued a comedy. Immediately after the adoption
of the substitute, a reconsideration of the vote was
moved by Mr. Cameron, of Pennsylvania, at the request
of Mr. Crittenden, which on a subsequent day was carried.
The question was then allowed to sleep on the
table, until, unexpectedly, on the last legislative day of
the session, just before the expiration of the Congress,
and after the withdrawal of the Southern Senators, it
was called up by Mr. Mason, of Virginia, when Mr.
Clark again offered his substitute, which was lost by
a vote of 22 nays against 14 yeas, several Senators expressing
a desire to vote directly on the original propositions.
On these propositions the final vote stood,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
yeas 19, nays 20, as follows.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><i>Yeas</i>,&mdash;Messrs. Bayard, Bigler, Bright, Crittenden, Douglas,
Gwin, Hunter, Johnson of Tennessee, Kennedy, Lane,
Latham, Mason, Nicholson, Polk, Pugh, Rice, Sebastian,
Thomson, Wigfall,&mdash;19.</p>

<p><i>Nays</i>,&mdash;Messrs. Anthony, Bingham, Chandler, Clark, Dixon,
Doolittle, Durkee, Fessenden, Foot, Foster, Grimes, Harlan,
King, Morrill, Sumner, Ten Eyck, Trumbull, Wade,
Wilkinson, Wilson,&mdash;20.</p>

</div>

<p>So the joint resolution of Mr. Crittenden, with its
various propositions, was rejected. The final withdrawal
of the Senators from seceding States obviously aided
this result.</p>

<p>As the session was coming to a close, a joint resolution
was received from the House of Representatives
proposing yet another amendment to the Constitution,
as follows.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“No amendment shall be made to the Constitution which
will authorize or give to Congress the power to abolish or
interfere within any State with the domestic institutions
thereof, including that of persons held to labor or service
by the laws of said State.”</p>

</div>

<p>Bills and joint resolutions must be read on three
several days; but on ordinary occasions they receive
their first and second readings the same day. Mr. Sumner,
unwilling that this other attempt should be hurried
through the Senate, objected to the second reading
on the first day, and the next day had a question
with Mr. Douglas on the correction of the Journal,
which failed to record his objection. On his motion
the Journal was corrected.<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a> The Senate then suspended
the rule requiring the three readings of a Constitutional<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
amendment on three separate days, and proceeded to
the consideration of the proposed amendment. Mr.
Pugh, of Ohio, spoke lightly of its composition, saying:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I think it was De Quincey who said, that, next to the
duty which a man owes God and his country and his family,
it was his duty to preserve the purity of his mother
tongue. The Constitution of the United States is written
in excellent English; but if this amendment be expressed
in the English language, or by any rule of grammar, I do
not understand it.”</p>

</div>

<p>Mr. Crittenden replied, that he could “bear with
bad English, when it expressed a good thing.”</p>

<p>The vote on its passage was 24 yeas to 12 nays, as
follows.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><i>Yeas</i>,&mdash;Messrs. Anthony, Baker, Bigler, Bright, Crittenden,
Dixon, Douglas, Foster, Grimes, Gwin, Harlan, Hunter,
Johnson of Tennessee, Kennedy, Latham, Mason, Morrill,
Nicholson, Polk, Pugh, Rice, Sebastian, Ten Eyck, Thomson,&mdash;24.</p>

<p><i>Nays</i>,&mdash;Messrs. Bingham, Chandler, Clark, Doolittle,
Durkee, Foot, King, Sumner, Trumbull, Wade, Wilkinson,
Wilson,&mdash;12.</p>

</div>

<p>Two thirds of the Senate present voting for the joint
resolution, it was agreed to. The proposed amendment
to the Constitution was never adopted by the States.
It remains in the national archives, a singular instance
of bad composition, and the monument of a fruitless
effort.</p>

<p>This final attempt to appease the spirit of Rebellion
was on the last legislative day of the session. The 3d of
March being Sunday, the Senate, without adjourning,
took a recess from Saturday evening till Sunday evening<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
at seven o’clock, thus making the 2d of March the
concluding day of that Congress, which was prolonged
till noon of March 4th. During the sitting of Sunday,
from seven o’clock in the evening till midnight, Mr.
Sumner, who had never been in the habit of pairing,
was induced to pair with Mr. Polk, of Missouri, who
was unwilling to transact business on Sunday. His
scruples did not prevent him from joining the Rebellion,
for which he was subsequently expelled from the
Senate on Mr. Sumner’s motion.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The Crittenden Compromise attracted attention not
only in Congress, but throughout the country.</p>

<p>Meanwhile a Boston committee arrived at Washington,
composed of leading citizens, with Hon. Edward
Everett as chairman, to urge an adjustment by mutual
surrender. Mr. Everett called upon Mr. Sumner at his
lodgings, and with much emotion urged him to bring
forward some conciliatory proposition, saying, “You are
the only person who can introduce such a proposition
with chance of success.” Mr. Sumner replied: “You
are mistaken in supposing that I might have success
with compromise, if I could bring it forward. If I am
strong with the North, it is because of the conviction
that I cannot compromise; but the moment I compromised,
I, too, should be lost.”</p>

<p>All in Massachusetts were not like this committee.
The tone of many was expressed by a venerable citizen,
and an able writer, connected with the press during a
long life, Joseph T. Buckingham, who closed a firm and
courageous letter, under date of January 11, 1861, with
the words,&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquote">

<p>“God bless <em>you</em>, and <em>all</em> who keep a stiff backbone! For
those who yield, I care not what becomes of them.”</p>

</div>

<p>On the 19th of January, 1861, the General Assembly
of Virginia adopted a series of resolutions, proposing a
Convention of States at Washington, February 4, 1861,
to attempt an adjustment of the pending difficulties,
and recommending the propositions of Mr. Crittenden
reinforced. The action of the Virginia Assembly was
communicated to the Senate by message of President
Buchanan, January 28th. Mr. Sumner, being against
all compromise, could not regard with favor any attempt
in that direction. A misrepresentation of his position
was corrected by the following telegram in Northern
papers.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="right medium">“<span class="smcap">Washington</span>, January 30, 1861.</p>

<p>“The report, that Senator Sumner has approved the objects
of the Convention which is to assemble here at the call
of Virginia, is a mistake. Mr. Sumner regards that call as
part of the treasonable conspiracy against the National Government,
and does not see how Northern men can have anything
to do with it, unless they are ready in some way to
play into the hands of the traitors.</p>

<p>“Mr. Sumner has always held that any change by the
North from its attitude of firmness and repose can have no
other effect than the encouragement of treason.”</p>

</div>

<p>A telegraphic correspondence further shows his
position.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="right medium">“<span class="smcap">Boston</span>, January 31, 1861.</p>

<p class="noindent">“<span class="smcap">Hon. Charles Sumner</span>:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Do you favor sending Commissioners to Washington 4th
February?</p>

<p class="sig">“<span class="smcap">George L. Stearns.</span>”</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>

<hr class="tb" />

<p class="right medium">“<span class="smcap">Washington</span>, January 31, 1861.</p>

<p class="noindent">“<span class="smcap">George L. Stearns</span>, Esq., Boston:&mdash;</p>

<p>“I am against sending Commissioners to treat for the
surrender of the North. Stand firm.</p>

<p class="sig">“<span class="smcap">Charles Sumner.</span>”</p>

</div>

<p>Alone of the Massachusetts delegation Mr. Sumner
declined to unite with his colleagues in recommending
to the Governor the appointment of Commissioners.
This isolation was the occasion of a report which is
mentioned in a letter of S. M. Booth, written, under date
of February 2d, from his prison at Milwaukee, where
he was suffering for aiding a fugitive slave.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The telegraph assigns you the enviable position of standing
‘solitary and alone’ among the Massachusetts representatives,
as inflexibly opposed to compromise with rebels
for the benefit of Slavery. I cannot believe you are so
entirely forsaken, yet I greatly fear the country is to be dishonored
and the Republican party dissolved.… Rest
assured that the masses of the Republican party do not
sympathize with the Compromisers of the Republican party,
nor appreciate that statesmanship which consists in yielding
vital principles to the demands of the Slave Power. The
‘Barbarism of Slavery’ is now demonstrated before ‘all
Israel and the sun.’ I see little good to come from the
election of Lincoln, if the platform of the opposing candidates
is to be adopted by the Republican leaders. Indeed,
it were far better that Slavery should triumph under the
rule of Douglas or Breckinridge than under the rule of
Lincoln.”</p>

</div>

<p>So Mr. Sumner thought, and he acted accordingly.
His correspondence with Governor Andrew at this time
was constant and earnest. The latter was resolute
against Compromise. In a letter of January 20th, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
Governor wrote:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“From war, pestilence, and famine, from all assaults of
the world, the flesh, and the Devil, good Lord, deliver us,&mdash;but
most especially from any compromise with traitors, or
any bargain with Slavery!”</p>

</div>

<p>Under date of January 30th, the Governor wrote:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I think we had better be present by good men in the
Conference, if there is to be one, than to be misrepresented
by volunteers, or be wholly outside, unheard, and misinformed
of the plans and doings inside. Our Committee
on Federal Relations will report good resolutions, I think,
which will leave us free of complicity with the heresy of
the Virginia resolutions, and secure the dignity and fairness
of our position.”</p>

</div>

<p>Another letter from Massachusetts said, that, if Massachusetts
did not send representatives, “the Boston
Hunkers would send a delegation, which would not
be desirable.”</p>

<p>The Commissioners appointed by the Governor were,
John Z. Goodrich, Charles Allen, George S. Boutwell,
Francis B. Crowninshield, Theophilus P. Chandler, John
M. Forbes, and Richard P. Waters,&mdash;all firm against
any new concession to Slavery.</p>

<p>Against their influence and votes, the Convention,
known as the “Peace Congress,” presented a series of
propositions similar in character and surrender to those
of Mr. Crittenden, sharing also a similar fate.</p>

<p>During these various efforts, President Buchanan was
earnest for the Crittenden Compromise. An interview
of Mr. Sumner with him, reported in the Northern papers,
shows his desire for this terrible concession.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquote">

<p class="right medium">“<span class="smcap">Washington</span>, February 4.</p>

<p>“Much interest is manifested in the interview between
President Buchanan and Senator Sumner. Mr. Sumner visited
the President, at the request of Governor Andrew, to
learn his answer to the Massachusetts offer of military aid;
that done, Mr. Sumner said,&mdash;</p>

<p>“What else can Massachusetts do for the good of the
country?</p>

<p>“Mr. <span class="smcap">Buchanan</span>. A great deal. No State more.</p>

<p>“Mr. <span class="smcap">Sumner</span>. I should like to know what.</p>

<p>“Mr. <span class="smcap">Buchanan</span> (after a pause). Adopt the Crittenden
propositions.</p>

<p>“Mr. <span class="smcap">Sumner</span>. Is that necessary?</p>

<p>“Mr. <span class="smcap">Buchanan</span>. It is.</p>

<p>“Mr. <span class="smcap">Sumner</span>. Massachusetts has not acted directly on
these propositions, which seek to give Slavery Constitutional
protection in Territories, and disfranchise large numbers of
her citizens; but I believe such are the convictions of the
Massachusetts people that they would never consent to any
such thing.</p>

<p>“Mr. Sumner repeated his assurance in the strongest language.</p>

<p>“The President said he felt discouraged by the reply.</p>

<p>“Mr. Sumner spoke of the common ground where all
who truly loved the country could stand. It was the Constitution
as administered by Washington. The verdict of
the people last November should be recognized without price
or condition.</p>

<p>“The President said he and Mr. Sumner must differ politically.</p>

<p>“Mr. Sumner assured the President that the people of
Massachusetts were attached to the Union; that real disunionists
there might all be put in an omnibus; but Massachusetts
could not be brought to sacrifice or abandon her
principles, and in that he sincerely joined.”</p>

</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span></p>
<p>This interview was described by Mr. Sumner in one
of his familiar letters to Governor Andrew, which is
copied from the private files of the latter.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="right medium"><span class="smcap">Washington</span>, February 3, 1861.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Andrew</span>,&mdash;I saw the President yesterday.
He was astonished to learn that the resolutions
had not been acknowledged, and said that it should be
done.</p>

<p>Afterwards I said to him, “Mr. President, what else
can we do in Massachusetts for the good of the country?”
A pause. “Much, Mr. Sumner.” “What?”
said I. “Adopt the Crittenden propositions,” said he.
“Is that necessary?” said I. “Yes,” said he. To
which I replied, “Massachusetts has not yet spoken
directly; but I feel authorized to say, that, such are
the unalterable convictions of her people, they would
see their State sunk below the sea, and turned into
a sand-bank, before they would adopt propositions acknowledging
<em>property in men</em>, and disfranchising a portion
of her population.” I think I was right.</p>

<p>In God’s name stand firm! <em>Don’t cave</em>, Andrew! God
bless you!</p>

<p class="sig"><span class="smcap">Charles Sumner.</span></p>

<p>Save Massachusetts from any “surrender,” THE
LEAST!</p>

<p class="sig">C. S.</p>

</div>

<p>The latter part of the letter alluded to reports that
the Legislature was disposed to repeal or modify the
well-known laws for the protection of Personal Liberty,
passed originally as a defence against the Fugitive Slave
Bill. Compromisers urged this surrender, particularly
after the special call in the Crittenden propositions. At
the request of anxious citizens at home, Mr. Sumner<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
wrote to members of the Legislature against any such
sacrifice, insisting, that, with the manifest determination
of the South, it could do no good, while plainly
the laws should be maintained for the sake of Liberty.
His views were briefly expressed in a private letter
to Hon. William Claflin, Chairman of the Republican
State Committee, and President of the Massachusetts
Senate.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent medium" style="float: left;">[<i>Private.</i>]</p>

<p class="right medium" style="float: right;"><span class="smcap">Washington</span>, January 1, 1860.</p>

<p style="clear: both;"><span class="smcap">My dear Claflin</span>,&mdash;Massachusetts has now an important
post. Her most difficult duty is to be true to
herself and her own noble history. In the name of
Liberty, I supplicate you not to let her take any backward
step,&mdash;<em>not an inch, not a hair’s breadth</em>.</p>

<p>It is now too late for any fancied advantage from
such conduct. The crisis is too far advanced. It only
remains that she do nothing by which Liberty suffers,
or her principles are recanted.</p>

<p>Remember well, that not a word from our Legislature
can have the least influence in averting the impending
result. What the case requires is firmness which nothing
can shake.</p>

<p>Let the timid cry, but let Massachusetts stand stiff.
God bless her!</p>

<p>We are on the eve of great events, and this month
will try men’s souls. But our duty is clear as noonday,
and bright as the sun.</p>

<p class="sig">Ever yours,</p>

<p class="sig2"><span class="smcap">Charles Sumner</span>.</p>

</div>

<p>In a letter dated January 15, Governor Andrew suggested
a communication from the Massachusetts delegation,
“that it is not important or desirable that we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
should repeal the Personal Liberty Laws.” February
17th, he announces, with something of exultation, the
unanimous report of the Committee of the Legislature
in harmony with his ideas.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I had no original expectation of getting such a result;
but I told some persons that they could not get anything
<em>through this room</em> [the Council Chamber] not conformable
to certain principles, and which did not contain certain details,
unless they marched it through by dragoons.”</p>

</div>

<p>A letter from Hon. D. W. Alvord, written from Greenfield,
Massachusetts, refers to the action of Mr. Sumner.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Those who believe that it is the first duty of a State to
protect its citizens from oppression, as much when the oppression
is threatened by the General Government as when
it comes from any other quarter, owe you especial thanks.
Your influence has saved the ‘Personal Liberty Laws’ of
this State from essential change. Such change would have
been strenuously resisted by many true men in the Legislature,
even had your advice been different; but your letters,
shown about among members, and the knowledge spread
through the Legislature that you advised against repeal or
essential modification, stiffened many weak backs, and rendered
any great change impossible.”</p>

</div>

<p>Thus at home, in the Legislature, as well as in Congress,
people were busy to find some form of surrender
inconsistent with those principles which had triumphed
at the Presidential election. Mr. Sumner was positive
against any surrender anywhere. A letter to Count
Gurowski, in New York, which has seen the light since
his death, is a contemporary record.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquote">

<p class="right medium"><span class="smcap">Washington</span>, January 8, 1861.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Count</span>,&mdash;Sunday evening I had a visit
from Thurlow Weed and Seward. The former said that
he found himself “alone,”&mdash;nobody united with him.
I rejoiced. &mdash;&mdash; and &mdash;&mdash; are here from New York
for the same object. They urge that we cannot have
a united North, unless we make an effort for adjustment;
to which I reply: “We have the verdict of the
people last November: that is enough.”</p>

<p>But these compromisers do not comprehend the
glory of a principle. <i>Périssent les colonies plutôt qu’un
principe!</i> That exclamation exalts a period which has
many things to be deplored.</p>

<p>The Slave States are mad. They will all move.
Nothing now but abject humiliation on the part of
the North can stay them. Nobody can foresee precisely
all that is in the future, but I do not doubt that
any conflict will precipitate the doom of Slavery. It
will probably go down in blood.…</p>

<p class="sig">Ever yours,</p>

<p class="sig2"><span class="smcap">Charles Sumner</span>.</p>

</div>

<p>During these efforts at compromise, the conspirators
proceeded in their work. South Carolina took the lead,
adopted an Ordinance of Secession December 20, 1860,
and shortly thereafter raised the Palmetto flag over the
custom-house and post-office at Charleston. Mississippi
followed, January 9, 1861; Florida, January 10; Alabama,
January 11; Georgia, January 19; and Louisiana,
January 26. January 21st the Senators of seceding
States withdrew from the Senate. Texas was not declared
out of the Union until March 4th, when her
Senators withdrew.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span></p>
<p>Another event will properly close this sketch. At
the end of December, 1860, Commissioners from South
Carolina arrived at Washington, in order to obtain the
complete withdrawal of the national troops. Major
Anderson, by a sudden movement, had transferred his
command from Fort Moultrie to Fort Sumter, which was
much easier to hold. Fort Moultrie and Castle Pinckney
were at once occupied by the Rebels. The country
was aroused, and insisted that Fort Sumter should not
be abandoned. It was held, until, after a bombardment
of thirty-four hours, it yielded, April 13, 1861.</p>

<p>I have letters constantly from New York as well as

the President persevered in his original policy of surrender
and treason, we should have been driven away

do not doubt this. But General Scott has applied
his best energies to measures of defence. He is satisfied
that the traitors cannot succeed here, whatever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
they may do elsewhere. He has force enough on hand
to hold the capital for hours against any attack which
can be expected, and within that time he can have
fifty thousand men from the North. A law maxim
says, <i>Cuique in sua arte credendum est.</i> Should he be
mistaken, his military reputation will suffer terribly.</p>

<p>You see as well as I, that any military assistance
must be invited by the Government. A march of
troops on our side would be a “first move” towards
hostilities. Our safety must depend upon the watchfulness
of the Government. But I agree with Mr.
Stearns, that it would be useful to have some faithful
men here who would make it a business to ascertain
the plans and purposes of the enemy.</p>

<p>Mr. Burleigh, a Republican of John Covode’s district,
has recently made an excursion into Maryland, where,
passing himself as a speculator in negroes, he thinks
he got into secrets. He reports a combination of ten
thousand men to seize the capital, and also another
conspiracy to assassinate Mr. Lincoln in Maryland, on
his way to Washington.</p>

<p>Our friends are all tranquil, except so far as disturbed
by Seward’s speech. If his propositions were pressed, I
think they would split the party. I regret very much
that he made them, and I protested most earnestly
against them. He read me his speech four days in
advance of its delivery. I pleaded with him, for the
sake of the cause, the country, and his own good name,
to abandon all his propositions, and simply to declare
that Mr. Lincoln would be inaugurated on the 4th of
March President of the United States, and rally the
country to his support. I do not think we should allow
this opportunity to pass without trying the question,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
whether a single State can break up the Union. What
is it worth, if held by any such tenure? I have no
concession or compromise of any kind to propose or
favor; least of all can I become party to any proposition
which sanctions Slavery directly or indirectly. I
deplore everything of this kind, however plausible, as
demoralizing to the country.</p>

<p>Pray keep Massachusetts sound and <em>firm</em>&mdash;<span class="smcap">FIRM</span>&mdash;FIRM&mdash;against
every word or step of concession.
God bless you!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Andrew</span>,&mdash;I think that our friends are
coming to the conclusion, that we can offer no terms of
concession or compromise, in order to please the Border
States. The question must be met on the Constitution

hold our Government subject to this asserted right of
secession. Should we yield now,&mdash;and any offer is concession,&mdash;every

<p>There is tranquillity now with regard to the capital.
General Scott feels safe, and others feel safe under his
wing. Virginia, it is said, will surely go.</p>

<hr class="r15" />

<p class="right medium"><span class="smcap">Senate Chamber</span>, January 23, 1861.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Andrew</span>,&mdash;You have doubtless received
my telegram. I found General Scott with the Secretary
of War, and read the letter you inclosed. They
said at once that no such guns had been ordered by the
National Government, and General Scott added that
they were, without doubt, intended for Fort Sumter.
He said they were “very formidable.” He thought
they were “already in a state of great forwardness.”
Of course you will see that Massachusetts does not
“imp the wings” of Treason.</p>

<p>Yesterday, before receiving your letter, I passed an
hour and a half with General Scott. He is not without
solicitude in regard to the capital. Information received<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
yesterday confirms the idea that there is a wide-spread
conspiracy. He will have one thousand men
here,&mdash;three companies of flying artillery, two companies
of infantry, and five companies from Fortress
Monroe. The place of the latter at Fortress Monroe
will be supplied by recruits from New York.</p>

<p>He cannot ride on horseback, but he proposes to accompany
Mr. Lincoln on the 4th of March in a carriage
with Commodore Stewart, each in his uniform.</p>

<p>Nothing that Massachusetts can do now can arrest
one single State. There can be no other result except
our own humiliation, and a bad example, which will be
felt by all other States. If Massachusetts yields one
hair’s breadth, other States may yield an inch or foot, a
furlong, or a mile. Pray keep the Legislature firm.
Don’t let them undo anything ever done for Freedom.</p>

<p>Good bye.</p>

<p class="sig">Ever yours,</p>

<p class="sig2"><span class="smcap">Charles Sumner</span>.</p>

<hr class="r15" />

<p class="right medium"><span class="smcap">Senate Chamber</span>, January 24, 1861.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Andrew</span>,&mdash;I have a suggestion to make
which is in harmony with one of your recent letters.</p>

<p>Mr. Dix,<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> in his letter of 18th January, on the present
resources of the country, says: “Before closing this
communication, I wish to call your attention to the fact
that there are deposited with twenty of the States, for
safe-keeping, over $28,000,000 <em>belonging to the United
States</em>, for the repayment of which the faith of these
States is pledged by written instructions on file in this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
department.”</p>

<p>Of course this money might be reclaimed; but the
Secretary does not propose to do so. These liabilities
may be made a basis of credit, if the States will volunteer
to indorse or guaranty the Treasury notes of
the Government to the extent of their respective liabilities.</p>

<p>I wish to suggest that our Legislature should at once
volunteer this aid to the General Government. Without
some assistance Mr. Lincoln will find the Treasury
empty. Beyond this consideration, you will appreciate
the influence of such an act of loyalty at this peculiar
moment.</p>

<p>Mr. Seward writes to-day to the Governor of New
York, and makes the same suggestion. Other Senators
will do the same. General Wilson unites with me.</p>

<p class="sig">Ever yours,</p>

<p class="sig2"><span class="smcap">Charles Sumner.</span></p>

<p>Wilson says he should like to see our State do this
promptly.</p>

<hr class="r15" />

<p class="right medium"><span class="smcap">Washington</span>, January 26, 1861.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Andrew</span>,&mdash;Yesterday I was with the Attorney-General,<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a>
an able, experienced, Northern Democratic
lawyer, with the instincts of our profession on
the relation of cause and effect. He drew me into his
room, but there were clerks there; opening the door into
another room, there were clerks there, too; and then
traversing five different rooms, he found them all occupied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
by clerks; when, opening the door into the entry,
he told me he was “surrounded by Secessionists,” who
would report in an hour to the newspapers any interview
between us,&mdash;that he must see me at some
other time and place,&mdash;that everything was bad as
could be,&mdash;that Virginia would certainly secede,&mdash;that
the conspiracy there was the most wide-spread and perfect,&mdash;that
all efforts to arrest it by offers of compromise,
or by the circulation of Clemens’s speech, were no
more than that (snapping his fingers),&mdash;that Kentucky
would surely follow, and Maryland, too. “Stop, Mr.
Attorney,” said I, “not so fast. I agree with you to this
point,&mdash;Maryland would go, except for the complication
of the National Capital, which the North will hold, and
also the road to it.”</p>

<p>Of course you will keep Massachusetts out of all
these schemes. If you notice the proposition for a
commission, say that it is summoned to make conditions
which contemplate nothing less than surrender of
cherished principles, so that she can have nothing to do
with it.</p>

<p>My opinion has been fixed for a long time. All the
Slave States will go, except Delaware, and perhaps
Maryland and Missouri,&mdash;to remain with us Free
States.</p>

<p>The mistake of many persons comes from this,&mdash;they
do not see that we are in the midst of a revolution,
where reason is dethroned, and passion rules instead.
If this were a mere party contest, then the circulation
of speeches and a few resolutions might do good. But
what are such things in a revolution? As well attempt
to hold a man-of-war in a tempest by a little anchor
borrowed from Jamaica Pond; and this is what I told<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
the Boston Committee with regard to their petition.</p>

<p>I have but one prayer: Stand firm, keep every safeguard
of Human Rights on our statute-book, and save
Massachusetts glorious and true.</p>

<p class="right medium"><span class="smcap">Senate Chamber</span>, January 28, 1861.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Andrew</span>,&mdash;I did not unite with the delegation
yesterday in recommending commissioners, and
I think they signed without much reflection, certainly
without any general conference.</p>

<p>My disposition in any matter not involving principle
is to keep the delegation <em>a Unit</em>, and I certainly would
not stand in the way now. Two things have been
pressed, both entitled to consideration: first, in the absence
of commissioners duly appointed, certain “Union-savers”
from Massachusetts, accidentally here, will work
into the Convention, and undertake to represent Massachusetts;
and, secondly, it is important that Massachusetts
should not be kept insulated. Both you can judge,
and I shall defer to your judgment.</p>

<p>Preston King concurred with me as to the true policy
of our States; but he did not think it worth while to
interfere positively by writing to the Governor of New
York.</p>

<p>Should you conclude to move, let two things be
guarded: first, the principles, by having it known that
Massachusetts has taken no step towards any acceptance
of the resolutions which are made the implied
basis of the proposed Convention; and, secondly, the men,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
by designating only the firmest, in whom there is no
possibility of concession or compromise, like &mdash;&mdash;, &mdash;&mdash;,
&mdash;&mdash;, &mdash;&mdash;, &mdash;&mdash;, &mdash;&mdash;; but you know the men better
than I do.</p>

<p>Last evening the Attorney-General was with me for a
long time, till after midnight. I know from him what
I cannot communicate. Suffice it to say, he does not
think it probable&mdash;hardly possible&mdash;that we shall be
here on the 4th of March. The President has been wrong
again, and a scene has taken place which will be historic,
but which I know in sacred confidence. General
Scott is very anxious. It is feared that the department
will be seized and occupied as forts. What then can be
done by the General, surgeons, and flying artillery?</p>

<p class="right medium"><span class="smcap">Senate Chamber</span>, January 28, 1861.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Andrew</span>,&mdash;Mr. Dix has proposed a form
of State guaranty to be used in New York. He thinks
it advisable to have the forms alike in the different
States.</p>

<p class="sig">Ever yours,</p>

<p class="sig2"><span class="smcap">Charles Sumner</span>.</p>

<p>I send a copy.</p>

<p>P. S.&mdash;<i>Timeo Danaos et dona ferentes.</i> Don’t let
these words be ever out of your mind, when you think
of any proposition from the Slave-Masters.</p>

<p><em>They are all essentially false, with treason in their
hearts, if not on their tongues.</em> How can it be otherwise?
Slavery is a falsehood, and its supporters are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
all perverted and changed. Punic in faith, Punic in
character, you are to meet all that they do or say with
denial or distrust.</p>

<p>Mr. Everett reported to me some smooth words of
John Tyler, which seem to have gone to the soul of the
eloquent son of Massachusetts. “Don’t trust him,” said
I, “he means to betray you.”</p>

<p>I know these men, and see through their plot.</p>

<p>The time has not yet come to touch the chords which
I wish to awaken. But I see my way clear. O God!
let Massachusetts keep true. It is all I now ask.</p>

<hr class="r15" />

<p class="right medium"><span class="smcap">Senate Chamber</span>, February 5, 1861.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Andrew</span>,&mdash;Ever remember, “Forewarned
is forearmed.” Since recent sincere propositions to
defend the capital, I have had no fear except from a
revolutionary movement in Maryland. That, as I have
repeatedly said, will depend upon Virginia. The recent
elections seem to show that she at least will take
time. This postpones the danger contingent upon her
course.</p>

<p>More than the loss of forts, arsenals, or the national
capital, <em>I fear the loss of our principles</em>.</p>

<p>These are now in greatest danger. Our Northern Fort
Sumter will be surrendered, if you are not aroused. In
my view, the vacillation of the Republicans is more fatal
than that of Buchanan.</p>

<p>Keep firm, and do not listen to any proposition.</p>

<p class="right medium"><span class="smcap">Senate Chamber</span>, February 6, 1861.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Andrew</span>,&mdash;It seems to me that nothing
is gained for the Union by the Virginia election <em>except
delay</em>, unless the North surrender everything. I have
always trusted that the North would not, and therefore
look to the secession of Virginia as impending,&mdash;sooner
or later to occur.</p>

<p>This delay seems like a beneficent intervention of
Providence to arrest the conflict, which a sudden movement
would have precipitated. It suspends the revolutionary
movement in Maryland, which was to begin the
18th,&mdash;five days after the Virginia Convention,&mdash;and
thus gives security to the capital.</p>

<p>Since General Scott has become wakeful, and has received
powers from the President, I have felt safe against
everything but a revolutionary movement.</p>

<p>Be assured I will keep you advised. I shall scent
the coming danger.</p>

<p>But do not be deceived by that fatal advice which
sees nothing but peace and security in the recent elections.</p>

<p>Chase has just left me. He thinks there may be
thirty Unionists <i>per se</i> in the Virginia Convention;
all the rest <em>only conditionally</em>,&mdash;the condition being
the resolutions on which the Massachusetts commissioners
are to deliberate. Bah! A friend, who was
with Mr. Rives this morning, tells me that he was
very bitter against Johnson, of Tennessee, for his Union
speech, and especially for saying “Secession is treason.”
He says that the persons called Unionists will be
for secession, if the South cannot have “Constitutional
guaranties.” The course of such a person as Mr. Rives,
who is said to be conservative, foreshadows the result.</p>

not a single weak joint in them.…</p>

<p>I pray constantly for courage at home. Let Massachusetts
be true and firm, and keep our friends from
division.</p>

<p>The news from Virginia continues to reveal the same
tendency,&mdash;secession, unless constitutional guaranties
are secured for Slavery. Without some change, contrary
to all legislative and other declarations, Virginia
must go out.</p>

<p>I hope that our Legislature will not pause in offering
its guaranty to the bonds of the National Government.
It ought to be done at once.</p>

<p>Did I ever tell you how much I enjoyed and admired
your old musket speech? It was well conceived
and admirably done. I am glad that Theodore Parker’s

the United States bonds. Let us give Government the
means of procuring money at once, and put her credit
on its legs.</p>

<p>There is tranquillity now. The Peace Conference has
not reached any point. It is evident that Virginia and
the other Border States will have to decide the question,
Which to choose, Union or Slavery? If they remain,
it must be in subjection to the Constitution and the
antislavery policy of the Fathers.</p>

<p>I do not tremble at anything from our opponents,
whoever they may be, but from our friends.</p>

<p>The New York commissioners, the majority, are stiff
and strong.</p>

<p>Every word of concession thus far has done infinite

At the same time I pressed the pardon. He will give

rather fixed against it.</p>

<p>Nothing has occurred to change my view of our affairs.
It seems to me that Virginia will secede. At
all events, if you expect this result, you will be best

<p>The Peace Conference is like the Senate,&mdash;powerless
to mature any system of harmony. And the question

<p class="plabeln"><span class="smcap">Speech in the Senate, on a Massachusetts Petition in Favor of
the Crittenden Propositions, February 12, 1861.</span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/line.png" width="80" height="16" alt="" />
</div>

<div class="medium">

<p>During weary, anxious weeks, while the Rebellion was preparing,
and Senators were leaving their seats to organize hostile governments,
Mr. Sumner resisted appeals to speak. An earnest character in Philadelphia
wrote to him, January 31st:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“May we not look to have <em>you</em> speak once more for us,&mdash;as a statesman,
not as a politician,&mdash;as a philanthropist, not as the representative of
a prospective Cabinet? Mr. Sumner, you know that Kansas was yesterday
admitted. God bless her, and God bless you, to whom under Him she owes
her deliverance, and the country owes the turning of the balances <em>against</em>
Slavery for all time to come. Now, if the whole country is on the eve of a
similar struggle, why should we not know it and act accordingly?”</p>

</div>

<p>Another zealous friend, writing from Massachusetts on the same day,
said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Why do we not hear your voice uplifted, in this critical, this dangerous
hour?”</p>

</div>

<p>It was hard to resist such appeals. But there were good friends,
agreeing with Mr. Sumner, who counselled silence. An incident unexpectedly
occurred which compelled him to speak, although briefly.</p>

<p>February 12, 1861, Mr. Crittenden presented a petition extensively
signed by people of Massachusetts, where, after setting forth that
“their sentiments towards the Union and towards their common country
have been misrepresented and misunderstood,” and further declaring
themselves “willing that all parts of the country should have
their full and equal rights under the Constitution, and recognizing
in the propositions of Hon. J. J. Crittenden a basis of settlement
which the North and the South may fairly and honorably accede to,
and which is well calculated to restore peace to the country,” the petitioners
conclude by asking the adoption of these propositions. The
petition purported to be from one hundred and eighty-two cities and
towns of Massachusetts, and to be signed by twenty-two thousand
three hundred and thirteen citizens of Massachusetts. In presenting
it, Mr. Crittenden remarked on the number of signatures in different
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>towns, mentioning especially Natick, the home of Senator Wilson,
and Boston, where there were more than fourteen thousand petitioners
out of nineteen thousand voters. And he added, that he felt “peculiar
and especial satisfaction” in presenting the petition.</p>

<p>On his motion the petition was laid on the table, which, under the
rules of the Senate, cut off debate, when Mr. Sumner moved the printing
of the petition, and on this motion spoke as follows.</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">MR. PRESIDENT,&mdash;As I desire to say a few words
on the petition, I move that it be printed.</p>

<p>These petitioners, I perceive, ask you to adopt what
are familiarly known as the Crittenden Propositions.
Their best apology, Sir, for such a petition is their
ignorance of the character of those propositions. Had
they known what they are, I feel sure they could not
have put their names to any such paper.</p>

<p>Those propositions go beyond the Breckinridge platform,
already solemnly condemned by the American people
in the election of Abraham Lincoln. If adopted,
they set aside the Republican platform, while they foist
into the National Constitution guaranties of Slavery
which the framers of that instrument never sanctioned,&mdash;which
Washington, Jefferson, Franklin, Patrick Henry,
and John Jay, according to the testimony of their lives
and declared opinions, would have scorned to sanction;
nor can there be any doubt, that, had such propositions
been made the condition of Union, this Union could
not have been formed.</p>

<p>Mr. Madison, in the Convention which framed the
National Constitution, taught his fellow-countrymen
that it is “wrong to admit in the Constitution the idea
that there can be property in men.”<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a> What manly vigor
and loftiness inspired that warning! Now these propositions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
not only interpolate the forbidden idea, but, proceeding
to its practical application, they run a visible
black line at latitude 36° 30´, extending the protection
of the Constitution itself over Slavery south of that
line, and then, making the case yet more offensive and
more impossible at the North, they carry it to all territory
hereafter acquired, so that the flag of the Republic,
as it moves southward, must always be the flag of Slavery,
while every future acquisition in that direction
must submit to the terrible doom,&mdash;and all this under
irrepealable text of Constitution, which, by supplementary
provision, is expressly placed beyond amendment.
In an age of civilization this is bad, very bad;
but they go further. There are to be new guaranties of
Slavery in the National capital, and in other places within
the National jurisdiction,&mdash;also in transporting slaves
to States and Territories,&mdash;also a reinforcement of the
Fugitive Slave Bill; and all these are so placed under
Constitutional safeguard as to exceed the permanence
of other provisions. Nor is even this all. As if to do
something inconceivably repugnant to just principles,
and especially obnoxious to the people of Massachusetts,
it is proposed to despoil our colored fellow-citizens
there of political franchises long time assured by the
institutions of that Liberty-loving Commonwealth. Before
the adoption of the National Constitution it was
declared in Massachusetts that there could be no distinction
of color at the ballot-box; and this rule of
equality is to be sacrificed, while fellow-citizens are
thrust out of rights which they have enjoyed for generations.</p>

<p>Sir, for these things, and others kindred, do these
petitioners now pray, insisting that they shall all be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
interpolated into the National Constitution,&mdash;while, in
entire harmony with this unparalleled betrayal, those
laws which have been established for the protection of
Personal Liberty are to be set aside, that the Slave-Hunter
may have free course. Such are things which
in the judgment of these petitioners “the North and the
South may honorably accede to,” while, in consideration
of these impossible sacrifices, the fee of the Fugitive
Slave Commissioners is modified, and it is declared that
the Slave-Trade shall not be revived. And this is the
compromise for which Massachusetts people in such
large numbers from cities and towns now pray!</p>

<p>I have infinite respect for the right of petition, and I
hope always to promote the interests and to represent
the just and proper wishes of my fellow-citizens; but
I cannot hesitate to declare my unfeigned regret that
these petitioners, uniting in such numbers, have missed
the opportunity of demanding plainly and unequivocally,
as lovers of the Union, two things, all-sufficient
for the present crisis, with regard to which I might
expect the sympathies of the Senator from Kentucky:
first, that the Constitution of the United States, as administered
by George Washington, shall be preserved
intact and blameless in its text, with no tinkering for
the sake of Slavery; and, secondly, that the verdict of
the people last November, by which Abraham Lincoln
was elected President of the United States, shall be enforced
without price or condition. Here is a platform
on which every patriot citizen can take his stand, having
over him the stars of the Union. How much better
than any proposition, scheme, or vain delusion of Compromise!
On such ground, all who really love the
Union of their fathers, without an <i>if</i> or a <i>but</i>, can plant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
themselves.</p>

<p>I remember, Sir, that in the debate on the night of
the passage of the Nebraska Bill,&mdash;it was at midnight,&mdash;I
made the declaration that all future compromise was
impossible.<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a> Events now taking place verify this truth.
It is obvious that existing difficulties can be arranged
only on permanent principles of justice, freedom, and
humanity. Any seeming settlement founded in abandonment
of principles will be but a miserable patchwork,
which cannot succeed. Only a short time ago
the whole country was filled with shame and dismay,
as the reports came to us of the surrender of the Southern
forts; and when it was known that Fort Sumter,
too, was about to be given up, a cry went forth from
the popular heart, by which that fortress was saved, at
least for the present. And now for the parallel. Propositions
are brought forward by the Senator from Kentucky,
and enforced by petition from my own State,
calling upon the North to surrender its principles,&mdash;to
surrender those impregnable principles of Human Rights
which constitute our Northern forts. It is even proposed
to surrender the principle of Freedom in the
Territories,&mdash;the Fort Sumter of the North. I trust,
Sir, that all these principles will yet be saved; but
plainly their safety depends upon the people, and not
upon a President; therefore must the people be heard,
as in that cry from the heart which only a few days
ago saved the other Fort Sumter, menaced by the
representatives of Slavery. For myself, if I stand with
many, with few, or alone, I have but one thing to say:
“No surrender of the Fort Sumter of the North! No<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
surrender of any of our Northern forts,&mdash;no, Sir, not
one of them!”</p>

<p>Bankers and merchants of New York and Boston tell
us that the Government shall not have money, if we do
not surrender. Then again, Sir, do I appeal to the people.
Surely the American people are not less patriotic
than the French. They only want the opportunity to
come forward and supply the necessities of the Government,
as the latter, at the hint of their Emperor,
came forward with money, all in small sums, for the
support of that war which ended in the liberation of
Italy. Our Government stands on the aggregate virtue
and intelligence of the people. Not only the rich and
fortunate, but the farmer, the mechanic, the laborer,
every citizen truly loving his country, will contribute
out of his daily life to uphold the Constitution and
the flag. From these small sums, inspired by a generous
patriotism, I am glad to believe we shall have
a full treasury, even if bankers and merchants stand
aloof.</p>

<p>There is but one thing now for the North to do:
it is to stand firm. The testimony of a great national
benefactor, who helped our country to Independence,
should be heard,&mdash;I mean Lafayette,&mdash;who, in his old
age, with experience ripened by time, contemplating
the terrible Revolution which had convulsed France,
as a surviving actor and a surviving sufferer, did not
hesitate to announce from his seat in the Chamber of
Deputies, after recognizing the unutterable calamities of
that Revolution, that, according to his solemn judgment,
they must be referred not so much to the bad passions
of men as to those timid counsels which sought to substitute
<em>Compromise</em> for <em>Principle</em>.<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a> The venerable patriot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
may well speak to his American fellow-citizens now,
and inspire them to stand firm against those timid
counsels which would make any such fatal substitution.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>Mr. Crittenden replied at some length, vindicating his propositions,
and also the Massachusetts petitioners, who, he said, had been charged
with “ignorance.” In the course of the debate the following passage
occurred.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Crittenden.</span> If the propositions I offered, and
which I offered with diffidence, are not adequate to the
purpose, if they ask too much, why have not gentlemen
moved to amend? Why has the honorable Senator sat
here for one month and more, and proposed no amendment
to the propositions which he now rises to condemn his constituents
for approving?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> Will the Senator allow me to say that
every time I could get an opportunity I have voted against
his propositions? I have missed no opportunity, direct or
indirect, of voting against them, from beginning to end,
every line and every word.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Crittenden.</span> I do not controvert that, Mr. President;
it may be so; but that is not what I am asking of
the gentleman. It is, that, if he desired union and conciliation
at all, why did he not move to amend the propositions
which he now condemns?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> I will answer the Senator: Because I
thought there could be no basis of peace on the Senator’s
propositions, which are wrong in every respect, in every
line, in every word. That is what I thought. I was for
the Constitution of the United States, the Constitution of
our fathers, as administered by George Washington.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Crittenden.</span> If that was all true, and the gentleman
desired an amicable settlement of the difficulties which
now threaten the country, had he no proposition whatever
to make?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> Certainly,&mdash;the proposition which I have
already made, that the Constitution, as administered by
George Washington, should be preserved pure and free from
any amendment for the sake of Slavery.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Crittenden.</span> Why did he not move that? Why
did he sit sullen and silent here for one month or more,
with his breast full of resentment? [<i>Applause in the galleries.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Presiding Officer</span> [Mr. <span class="smcap">Foster</span>, of Connecticut].
Order will be preserved in the galleries, or they will be
cleared immediately.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Crittenden.</span> With such a spirit of opposition to,
and thinking as he did of these resolutions, why did he not
propose to strike them all out?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> Will the Senator let me answer?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Crittenden.</span> Yes, I will.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> I did vote for the substitute of the Senator
from New Hampshire [Mr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>] just as soon as it could
come to a vote, and that expresses precisely my conviction.
That vote displaced the Senator’s propositions entirely.<a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Before the debate closed, Mr. Sumner replied briefly.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. President</span>,&mdash;I have no desire to prolong this
debate, or to occupy the time of the Senate. I content
myself with two remarks. The Senator from Kentucky
is not aware of his own popularity in Massachusetts, of
the extent to which his name is an authority there, of
the willingness of the people there to adopt anything
with the sanction of his respectable name. I do not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
think the distinguished Senator is aware of that fact;
consequently he does not see how easily the people of
Massachusetts might be seduced to adopt at sight a
proposition brought forward by him, which otherwise
they would at once reject. Now all that I suggest in
regard to these petitioners is, that, under the lead of the
distinguished Senator, they put their names to a petition
which I am sure they did not, in all respects and
in all its bearings, fully understand; and I must do
them the justice to believe, that, had they known the
true character of the propositions of the Senator, they
would not have signed petitions for their adoption.</p>

<p>This is all on that point; but I wish to make one
other remark. The Senator intimated, if I understood
him aright, that his propositions, at least in his own
mind, were not applicable to territory hereafter acquired.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Crittenden.</span> No: I do not mean to be understood
as saying that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> I understood the Senator so.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Crittenden.</span> I said I did not consider that proposition
as an essential part of mine,&mdash;that I did not intend
to insist upon it, if I found it would not be acceptable. I
did not intend that that should be any obstacle to an adjustment,
and I would propose to strike it out, if necessary.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> The Senator did not consider that an
essential part; and yet in the Journal of the Senate,
now before me, in the yeas and nays, I find his name
recorded in the affirmative on introducing those words,
“now held or hereafter to be acquired.” Here is the
record,&mdash;the name of the Senator from Kentucky answering
yea, when we were all asked to answer yea<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
or nay.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>This brief effort of Mr. Sumner at a critical moment found response,
not only from his constituents, but from the North generally. In
Massachusetts many made haste to testify that the petition praying
for such a shameful surrender had been signed by large numbers without
knowing its true character,&mdash;while the Common Council of Boston,
then controlled by Compromisers, also made haste to censure Mr. Sumner,
declaring, in formal resolution, that his assertion in the Senate
with regard to the petitioners was “undignified, unbecoming a Senator
and a citizen of Boston, and untrue.”</p>

<p>As through this remarkable petition, and the speech of Mr. Crittenden
in presenting it, Massachusetts was vouched for Slavery, a few
witnesses may be properly adduced to show how the signatures were
obtained, and also what was the real sentiment of the people there.</p>

<p>William Lloyd Garrison, always watchful for Human Rights, and
knowing the wiles of Compromise, wrote from Boston:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“For one, I desire to thank you for declaring in the Senate that the petition
from Boston, asking for any compromise to propitiate the South, did
not represent the sentiment even of the city, but was signed by multitudes
ignorantly and recklessly,&mdash;the left hand not knowing what the right hand
did. I wish it were in your power to have that list of names critically examined.
I am quite sure that hundreds of names would be proved to be
‘men of straw.’ I have been told that the names of Wendell Phillips,
Henry Ward Beecher, Theodore Parker (!),<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a> and my own, were appended to
it. This is possible, but hardly credible. Still, excepting the Border-Ruffian
returns in Kansas, I do not believe there was ever a petition more impudently
and fraudulently presented to a legislative assembly than the one
from this city.</p>

<p>“I congratulate you upon being the special object of the <i>Courier’s</i> malignant
abuse. Do not fear of being fully sustained by Massachusetts in
your boldest utterances; and how posterity will decide is easily seen.”</p>

</div>

<p>M. P. Kennard, an excellent citizen and business man, wrote from
Boston:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The petition was placed in the lobby of our post-office, under the charge
of a crier, who saluted every one who passed him with, ‘Sign this petition?’&mdash;and
it was thoughtlessly signed by men and boys, native and foreign.”</p>

</div>

<p>Charles W. Slack, of the newspaper press, wrote from Boston:&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquote">

<p>“You are entirely right relative to the signers of the Crittenden Petition.
Boys, non-voters, foreigners, anybody, were taken, who could write a name.
The city police canvassed all the out-of-the-way places, and took the names
they could gather.… Glad that you spoke as you did. We look to you
to give the key-note. None knows Massachusetts better than you, and none
will be more faithful to her, come weal or woe.”</p>

</div>

<p>Dr. William J. Dale, afterwards the Surgeon-General of Massachusetts,
wrote from Boston:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The other day a neighbor of ours, Mr. Brown, an intelligent citizen, a
provision dealer, corner of Derne and Temple Streets, stopped me and said,
‘If you ever write Mr. Sumner, tell him that I, with many others, signed
that Crittenden Petition under an entire misapprehension.’ Says he, ‘I
would cut off my right hand before it should sign so infamous a proposition.’
That is the feeling among the middling-interest people. The so-called
Union men assume the air and manner of slave-overseers. They have overdone
the thing here.”</p>

</div>

<p>J. Vincent Browne, afterwards Collector of Internal Revenue in the
Essex District of Massachusetts, wrote from Salem:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“At least twenty persons who signed the paper in this city have said to
me, ‘Why, Mr. Crittenden’s propositions are merely to restore the Missouri
Compromise. I was told so, when I signed.’ When the <em>truth</em> was told
them, as usual, they were <em>astonished</em>. And so men trifle with their rights,
and are trifled with.”</p>

</div>

<p>John Tappan, a venerable citizen, loving peace, but hating Slavery,
and anxious that Massachusetts should be right, wrote from Boston:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I thank you for it, and believe it speaks the sentiments of a vast majority
of <em>all parties</em> in this and the other New England States. The only reason
assigned by some of the signers is, that it was not expected that it would
pass as offered, but lead to some compromise.</p>

<p>“Be assured the heart of the Commonwealth is with you, and that, if ever
we were called upon for firmness in maintaining our Constitutional rights,
it is now; and although I pray God no blood may be shed in the conflict, yet
submission to the demands of Slavery is not to be the alternative.</p>

<p>“I rejoice the conflict has come in my day, although, on the verge of four-score,
I may not live to see harmony restored.”<a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Rev. John Weiss, the eloquent preacher and author, wrote from Milton,
Massachusetts:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Your little speech lies in the hand like an ingot,&mdash;dense and precious,
and of the color which charms my eyes at least. Nothing can be truer than
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>your statement, that multitudes of people do not know what they sign, when
they indorse the Crittenden propositions. I, for one, had not read them till
quite lately. They have not been freely ventilated in the newspapers. When,
the other day, the Boston papers undertook to print them formally, people
were shocked.… The 4th March will come with a fatal suddenness for
all the plotters and expecters and adjustment-mongers. Just at the proper
moment, not a moment too soon nor too late, you spoke a word which will
help to clear the air.”</p>

</div>

<p>Others wrote correcting the statement with regard to signatures in
different towns. Some in a few words exposed the petition. Professor
Convers Francis wrote from Cambridge: “The big Boston petition,
so far as I can learn, is regarded here as a piece of gammon, except, perhaps,
in certain quarters of the business world.” Rev. R. S. Storrs, the
venerable divine, wrote from Braintree: “A great hoax, that famous
petition for the Crittenden Compromise!” This testimony, which
might be extended indefinitely, will relieve Massachusetts from a painful
complicity, and help keep her history bright.</p>

<p>The resolutions of the Boston Common Council did not fare better
than the petition. Among newspapers, the <i>Boston Advertiser</i>
remarked:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“It is hardly necessary for us to say that we do not concur in all respects
in the policy which Mr. Sumner is understood to follow at this crisis; but
in the matter of this petition we certainly hold that he was plainly right.
And we are led to this belief by observing the industrious efforts made by
those who urged the signing of the petition to conceal the true meaning of
the scheme which is known as Mr. Crittenden’s.… It appears to us also
that Mr. Sumner gave not only the most friendly, but also a most natural,
account of the manner in which a large number of these petitioners must
have been led to this singular mistake.”</p>

</div>

<p>The <i>New York Tribune</i> stated the case.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“A great many dull people, and a few clever ones, lately signed a petition
asking Congress to adopt the Crittenden Compromise. When this document
was taken up in the Senate, Mr. Sumner said, with much calmness and in
the most courteous spirit, that he believed the signers had so high a regard
for the name of Crittenden that they had put their signatures to a paper
which they could not have fully understood in all its obligations, bearings,
and propositions. This was a very gentle letting-down of the Bostonians,
much more tender treatment than they deserved. Nevertheless, the remark
raised a breeze in the respectable city, such as only a small thing can create
in that place. It would never do to say that any Boston man or boy
could sign a paper the whole of which he had not read and digested. So the
Common Council, of all bodies in that town, took up the matter, and actually
passed a vote of censure on Senator Sumner for mildly hinting that the
signers aforesaid were rather hasty than wicked, stupid, or weak.”</p>

</div>

<p>A sonnet by David A. Wasson, which appeared at this time, expresses
gratitude to Mr. Sumner, with small sympathy for compromise
in any form.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

</div>

<div class="medium">

<p>Mr. Sumner contemplated a speech reviewing the various propositions
of Compromise, but he never made it. The following passages
are given, as proposed at the time.</p>

</div>

<p class="center">…</p>

<p class="dropcap">I would not say a word except of kindness and
respect for the Senator of Kentucky [Mr. <span class="smcap">Crittenden</span>].
But that Senator must pardon me, if I insist
that he is entirely unreasonable in pressing his impracticable
and unconstitutional propositions so persistently
in the way of most important public business. Yesterday
it hindered a great measure of Internal Improvement.
To-day it blocks the admission of a State into
this Union, being none other than Kansas, which has
earned a better hospitality.</p>

<p>The Senator makes his appeal in the name of the
Union. But I must remind him that he takes a poor
way of showing that attachment to the Union which he
avers. He turns round and lectures us who are devoted
to the Union, when his lecture should be addressed
to the avowed and open Disunionists in this
Chamber. Nay, more, he actually sides with the Disunionists
in their claims. Imagine Washington, Franklin,
Jefferson, John Jay, Andrew Jackson, or Henry
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>Clay, in the place of the venerable Senator. They would
not wheel towards the known friends of the Union,
and ask an impossible surrender of sacred principles,
but rather face to face address the Disunionists frankly,
plainly, austerely, calling upon them to renounce their
evil schemes; to acknowledge the National Constitution,
and especially in this age of light to make no new
demands for Slavery.</p>

<p>In reply to the Senator, who so constantly lectures
us, I say, look to the good examples of our history; take
counsel of the Spirit of Nationalism, rather than Sectionalism,
and be willing to defend the Constitution <em>as
it is</em>, rather than <em>patch it over</em> with propositions which
our fathers would have disowned.</p>

<p class="center">…</p>

<p>Putting aside all question of concession or compromise,
the single question remains, <em>How shall we treat
the seceding States?</em> And this is the question which
the new Administration will be called to meet. I see
well that it will naturally bear much and forbear long,&mdash;that
it will be moved by principle, and not by passion,&mdash;and
that it will adopt the harsh instrumentalities
of power only when all other things have failed. And
I see well the powerful allies which will be enlisted on
its side. There will be the civilization of the Christian
world, speaking with the innumerable voices of the press,
and constituting a Public Opinion of irresistible energy.
There will be the great contemporary example of Italy,
after a slumber of centuries aroused to assertion of her
rights,&mdash;and of Russia also, now completing that memorable
act of Emancipation by which Freedom is assured
to twenty millions of serfs. There will be also
the concurring action of European powers, which, turning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
with disgust from a new confederacy founded on
Human Slavery, will refuse to recognize it in the Family
of Nations. There will be also the essential weakness
of Slavery with the perils of servile insurrection,
which, under the influence of this discussion, must become
more and more manifest in every respect. There
will be also the essential strength of Freedom, as a
principle, carrying victory in its right hand. And there
will be Time, which is at once Reformer and Pacificator.
Such are some of the allies sure to be on the side of
the Administration.</p>

<p class="plabeln"><span class="smcap">Report from Committee on Foreign Relations, advising the
President to submit the San Juan Boundary Question to
Arbitration, in the Senate, March 19, 1861.</span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/line.png" width="80" height="16" alt="" />
</div>

<div class="medium">

<p>By the withdrawal of Southern Senators, the Republicans were left
with a majority in the Senate, enabling them to reorganize the Standing
Committees, which was done March 8, 1861. At the head of the
Finance Committee was Mr. Fessenden, instead of Mr. Hunter,&mdash;of the
Judiciary Committee, Mr. Trumbull, instead of Mr. Bayard,&mdash;of the
Military Committee, Mr. Wilson, instead of Mr. Jefferson Davis,&mdash;and
of the Naval Committee, Mr. Hale, instead of Mr. Mallory. Mr.
Sumner was appointed Chairman of the Committee on Foreign Relations,
in place of Mr. Mason, of Virginia, who had held this position
from December 8, 1851. With the former on the new Committee were
Messrs. Collamer, of Vermont, Doolittle, of Wisconsin, Harris, of New
York, Douglas, of Illinois, Polk, of Missouri, and Breckinridge, of
Kentucky. The appointment of Mr. Sumner to this important position
was contrasted with his treatment at an earlier day, when the
omission of his name from any committee was justified on the ground
that he was “outside of any healthy political organization in this
country,” and this Senatorial sally was received with “laughter.”<a name="FNanchor_141_141" id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a>
Mr. Hale and Mr. Chase were in the same category. Only Democrats
and Whigs were accepted: such was the Law of Slavery. At
last this was all changed.</p>

<p>The reorganization of the Committees attracted the attention of the
press at home and abroad. It was properly recognized as marking a
change from old to new. The London <i>Star</i>, in an elaborate article on
the transition, welcomed especially the new Chairman of the Committee
of Foreign Relations.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The Republican Senators have selected for the Chairman of this Committee
the Hon. Charles Sumner, a statesman deservedly honored in this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>country, not only for his eloquence as an orator, but for his unswerving
fidelity to the cause of Freedom. No man could have been chosen for this
office in every respect more acceptable to the English people. It is not only
as the Antislavery legislator, who, from the first moment that he took his
seat in the Senate as the representative of Massachusetts, has ever raised
his voice and given his vote for the hapless negro,&mdash;it is not only as the patriot
who almost suffered martyrdom on the floor of the Senate Chamber
from the ruffian hand of Preston S. Brooks, that the English people will be
disposed to regard his appointment with hearty approval: he has established
other claims to our sympathy and admiration, which we must not be
slow to recognize. Mr. Sumner is well known in this country&mdash;scarcely
less, indeed, than in America&mdash;as the stanch friend of Peace. Years ago,
in his famous oration on the True Glory of Nations, he set forth the advantages
of a pacific policy, with arguments as cogent and irresistible as those
which have been employed by Mr. Cobden, and with an eloquence of language
and a fertility of illustration which revived the oratory of classic
times.…</p>

<p>“And if during the period of Mr. Lincoln’s administration causes of dispute
should unhappily arise between America and Great Britain, or any other
foreign power, Mr. Sumner will not fail to point to <em>arbitration as the only
reasonable and satisfactory mode</em> of settling international differences. <em>He
will not, if he can help it, permit San Juan to be made a casus belli</em>, or tolerate
any more of those periodical expeditions against the weak and effeminate
republics of South America, by which Mr. Buchanan and his predecessors
treated with contempt the solemn injunctions of the Fathers of the Republic,
that their posterity should avoid the fatal quicksands of European diplomacy,
and abstain from intermeddling with the affairs of other states.”</p>

</div>

<p>The very questions anticipated by the London journal were presented
at an early day, even before its article could reach Washington. The
advice of the Senate was asked by the President on submitting the
San Juan Question to arbitration.</p>

<p>March 16, 1861, the following Message from President Lincoln was
read in Executive Session, and on motion of Mr. Sumner referred to
the Committee on Foreign Relations.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent">“<span class="smcap">To the Senate</span>:&mdash;</p>

<p>“The Senate has transmitted to me a copy of the Message sent by my
predecessor to that body on the 21st day of February last, proposing to take
its advice on the subject of a proposition made by the British Government
through its minister here to refer the matter in controversy between that
Government and the Government of the United States to the arbitrament of
the King of Sweden and Norway, the King of the Netherlands, or the Republic
of the Swiss Confederation.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>

<p>“In that Message my predecessor stated that he wished to submit to the

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“‘Will the Senate approve a Treaty referring to either of the sovereign

the United States and Great Britain concerning the boundary line between

to the Treaty as nearly as possible? Which of the three powers named
by Great Britain as an arbiter shall be chosen by the United States?’</p>

</div>

<p>“I find no reason to disapprove of the course of my predecessor in this
important matter, but, on the contrary, I not only shall receive the advice

</div>

<p>From this Message it appears that the subject had been already before
the Senate on the submission of President Buchanan in the last
days of his Administration. In his Message the latter stated these
precise questions:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Will the Senate approve a treaty referring to either of the sovereign
powers above named [Sweden, the Netherlands, or Switzerland] the dispute
now existing between the Governments of the United States and Great
Britain concerning the boundary line between Vancouver’s Island and the
American continent?</p>

<p>“In case the referee shall find himself unable to decide where the line is
by the description of it in the Treaty of June 15, 1846, shall he be authorized
to establish a line according to the Treaty as nearly as possible?</p>

<p>“Which of the three powers named by Great Britain as an arbiter shall
be chosen by the United States?”</p>

</div>

<p>February 27, 1861, Mr. Mason, from the Committee on Foreign
Relations, reported the following Resolution, directly responsive to the
questions proposed.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<i>Resolved</i>, That in the opinion of the Senate the boundary in dispute between
the Governments of Great Britain and the United States should be referred
to the arbitrament and final award of an umpire to be agreed on
between the two Governments; that such umpire should, if practicable, determine
said boundary as the same is prescribed in the Treaty aforesaid; or
if that be not practicable, then that he be authorized to establish a boundary,
conforming as nearly as may be to that provided by said Treaty.</p>

<p>“And that, of the three powers referred to in the Message of the President,
the Senate would indicate as such umpire the Republic of the Swiss Confederation.”</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span></p>

<p>This was the last diplomatic act of Mr. Mason as Chairman of the
Committee on Foreign Relations.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>March 19, 1861, Mr. Sumner submitted the following Report, which
was his first diplomatic act as Chairman.</p>

</div>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="hanging">The Committee on Foreign Relations, to whom was referred
the Message of the President of the United States dated
the 16th instant, with the documents accompanying it,
have had the same under consideration, and now report.</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">The Treaty concluded between Great Britain and
the United States on the 15th of June, 1846, provided
in its first Article that the line of boundary between
the territories of her Britannic Majesty and those
of the United States, from the point on the 49th parallel
of north latitude, to which it was ascertained,
should be continued westward along this parallel, “to
the middle of the channel which separates the continent
from Vancouver’s Island, and thence southerly, through
the middle of said channel and of Fuca’s Straits, to the
Pacific Ocean.” When the commissioners appointed by
the two Governments to mark the boundary line came
to that part of it required to run southerly through
the channel dividing the continent from Vancouver’s
Island, they differed entirely in their opinions, not
only concerning the true point of deflection from the
49th parallel, but also as to the channel intended in
the Treaty. After long discussion, producing no result,
they reported a disagreement to their respective Governments.
Since then the two Governments, through their
ministers here and at London, have carried on a voluminous
correspondence on the matter in controversy,
each sustaining the conclusion of its own commissioner,
and neither yielding in any degree to the other. Meanwhile<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
the unsettled condition of this question produced
serious local disturbance, and on one occasion threatened
to destroy the harmonious relations existing between
Great Britain and the United States, causing serious
anxiety.</p>

<p>If our construction of the Treaty be right, the island
of San Juan, with other small islands, will fall to the
United States, while, if the British interpretation be
adopted, these islands will be on their side of the line.
President Buchanan, in his Message to the Senate of
February 21, 1861, declared his conviction that the
territory thus in dispute “is ours by the Treaty fairly
and impartially construed.” But the British Government,
on their side, insist that it is theirs. The argument
on both sides seems to have been exhausted.</p>

<p>Under these circumstances, it appears from the correspondence
submitted to the Senate, that General Cass,
Secretary of State, by letter of June 25, 1860, to Lord
Lyons, the British Minister at Washington, invited the
British Government to make a proposition of adjustment.
Here are his words:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“And I have it further in charge to inform your Lordship,
that this Government is ready to receive and fairly to
consider any proposition which the British Government may
be disposed to make for a mutually acceptable adjustment,
with an earnest hope that a satisfactory arrangement will
speedily put an end to all danger of the recurrence of those
grave questions which have more than once threatened to
interrupt that good understanding which both countries
have so many powerful motives to maintain.”</p>

</div>

<p>The reply of the British Government to this invitation
was communicated by Lord Lyons, in a letter to
General Cass, dated December 10, 1860, in the course<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
of which he uses the following language.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“In reference to the line of the water boundary intended
by the Treaty, with respect to which also her Majesty’s
Government have been invited by the United States Government
to make a proposition for its adjustment, I am instructed
to inform you that her Majesty’s Government are
glad to reciprocate the friendly sentiments expressed in your
note of the 25th of June, and will not hesitate to respond to
the invitation which has been made to them.</p>

<p>“It appears to her Majesty’s Government that the argument
on both sides being nearly exhausted, and neither
party having succeeded in producing conviction on the
other, the question can only be settled by arbitration.”</p>

</div>

<p>Lord Lyons then proceeds to details connected with
the offered arbitration, and, in behalf of his Government,
proposes that the King of the Netherlands, or
the King of Sweden and Norway, or the President of
the Federal Council of Switzerland should be invited to
be arbiter.</p>

<p>Upon these facts the President submits to the consideration
of the Senate the following interrogatories.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Will the Senate approve a Treaty referring to either of
the sovereign powers above named the dispute now existing
between the Governments of the United States and
Great Britain concerning the boundary line between Vancouver’s
Island and the American continent?</p>

<p>“In case the referee shall find himself unable to decide
where the line is by the description of it in the Treaty of
June 15, 1846, shall he be authorized to establish a line
according to the Treaty as nearly as possible?</p>

<p>“Which of the three powers named by Great Britain as
an arbiter shall be chosen by the United States?”</p>

</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span></p>
<p>The Committee, in conclusion, recommend to the Senate
the adoption of the following Resolution.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<i>Resolved</i>, That, in pursuance of the Message of the
President of the 16th instant, the Senate advises a reference
of the existing dispute between the Government of the
United States and the Government of Great Britain, concerning
the boundary line which separates Vancouver’s
Island and the American continent, to the arbitration of a
friendly power, with authority to determine the line according
to the provisions of the Treaty of 15th June, 1846, but
without authority to establish any line other than that provided
for in the Treaty.</p>

<p>“And of the three powers named by Great Britain, the
Senate advises that the Republic of Switzerland be chosen
by the United States as arbiter.”</p>

</div>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="medium">

<p>On two different days the Senate proceeded with this resolution,
when, March 27, 1861, the day before the close of the Session, it was
ordered that its further consideration be postponed to the second Monday
of December next. This was done on the suggestion that the time
was not propitious for the arbitration of a disputed boundary line.
April 12, Fort Sumter was bombarded.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A difference between the resolution of Mr. Mason and that of Mr.
Sumner will be noted. The former declared that the umpire “should,
if practicable, determine said boundary as the same is prescribed in the
Treaty aforesaid; or if that be not practicable, then that he be authorized
to establish a boundary, <em>conforming as nearly as may be to that provided
by said Treaty</em>.” The latter resolution declared, that the arbiter
should have “authority to determine the line according to the provisions
of the Treaty of 15th June, 1846, <em>but without authority to
establish any line other than that provided for in the Treaty</em>.” The
obvious purpose was to prevent a compromise line. This same purpose
appears in the terms of the Treaty between the United States and Great
Britain, signed at Washington, May 8, 1871, where, after mentioning
the Article of the original Treaty under which the question arose, it
is declared, that, “whereas the Government of her Britannic Majesty
claims that such boundary line should, under the terms of the Treaty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
above recited, be run through the Rosario Straits, and the Government
of the United States claims that it should be run through the
Canal de Haro, it is agreed that the respective claims of the Government
of the United States and of the Government of her Britannic
Majesty shall be submitted to the arbitration and award of his Majesty
the Emperor of Germany, who, having regard to the abovementioned
Article of the said Treaty, shall decide thereupon, finally, and
without appeal, <em>which of these claims is most in accordance with the
true interpretation of the Treaty of June 15, 1846</em>.” This provision
follows substantially the early resolution of Mr. Sumner.</p>

<p class="plabeln"><span class="smcap">Speech before the Third Massachusetts Rifles, in the Armory

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/line.png" width="80" height="16" alt="" />
</div>

<div class="medium">

<p>After adjournment of the Senate, Mr. Sumner remained for some
time in Washington, as was his habit. Meanwhile occurred the bombardment
of Fort Sumter, and the President’s Proclamation, calling
for seventy-five thousand men to suppress insurrectionary combinations,
“and to cause the laws to be duly executed.” On the afternoon
of 18th April, 1861, amidst the general commotion, he left on his way
to Boston, stopping over night at Baltimore, where an incident occurred,
which, besides illustrating the state of the country, helps to
explain the brief speech which follows.</p>

<p>On arrival by the train, Mr. Sumner drove at once to Barnum’s
Hotel, where he entered his name in the open book. Taking a walk
before dark in the principal street, he was recognized by excited persons,
whose manner and language went beyond any ordinary occasion.<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a>
Early in the evening he called on a family friend, with whom he took
tea, surrounded by her children. Leaving her house about nine o’clock,
he walked slowly back to the hotel. When descending Fayette Street
by its side, he could not but observe an enormous assemblage of people,
with very little apparent government, in the open square at the foot
of the street. Entering the private door, which was at some distance
from the riotous crowd, he came upon a gentleman, who, addressing
him by name, expressed surprise at seeing him there, saying, “That
mob in the square is after you. Their leaders have been to the hotel
and demanded you. They were told that you were out,&mdash;that nobody
knew where you were, and that you had probably left town”;
and he wound up by insisting that it was not safe for Mr. Sumner to
continue at the hotel, or anywhere in town, if his place of stopping
were known. Without reply to this notice, Mr. Sumner walked down
the long corridor of the hotel, and, turning into the office, asked for his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>key. At once Mr. Barnum, with one of his assistants, took him into
a small back room, where they explained the condition of things, narrated
the visit of the leaders, and the answer they were able to give, by
which the mob were turned aside; but this temporary relief left them
still anxious, especially if Mr. Sumner’s return should be suspected,
and therefore they must request him to leave the hotel; and this was
enforced by saying that his longer stay was perilous to the hotel as well
as to himself, and that he must find shelter somewhere else. Mr. Sumner,
while declaring his sincere regret that he should be the innocent occasion
of peril to the hotel, said that there was nowhere else for him to
go,&mdash;that he had no right to carry peril to the house of a friend,&mdash;that
it was impossible for him to do this,&mdash;that he had come to the
hotel as a traveller, and he must claim his rights, believing that in
so large a structure there was more safety than in a private house, even
if there were any such where he could go. The interview ended in
conducting him to a chamber on a long entry of the third story, where
all the rooms were alike, when, after saying that nobody in the hotel
but themselves would know where he was, they left him alone. From
the window which opened on the street at the side of the hotel, he
could see the swaying multitude, and hear their voices. In the gray
of the morning he left for the Philadelphia Railroad.<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a></p>

<p>On the way to Philadelphia, he met a long train for Baltimore, containing
the Sixth Regiment of Massachusetts Volunteers, hurrying to
the defence of the national capital. It was the first regiment of volunteers
he had seen, and he was struck by the gayety of soldier life, which
overflowed as the train passed. On his arrival at Philadelphia, the
telegraph was announcing the tragedy which had befallen them.</p>

<p>The troops were passing through Baltimore from the Philadelphia
station, in the large horse-cars, and a portion had arrived at the Washington
station, when those behind were set upon by a mob, the successor
of that at the hotel on the preceding evening. Before they could
leave the station, the streets were barricaded, and the rails removed, so
that they were obliged to make their way on foot, amidst the growing
fury of the mob, which had increased to ten thousand. Stones, bricks,
and other murderous missiles were thrown at them. Then came pistol-shots.
As the soldiers saw their comrades fall, they fired. Several
of the assailants dropped upon the pavements, and others were
wounded. And so for two miles they fought their way to the Washington
station. Of the troops, four were killed, and thirty-six wounded.
That evening the regiment quartered at Washington, in the Senate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>Chamber.<a name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a> Thus, on the 19th of April, 1861, began and closed the
first encounter of the terrible war at hand.</p>

<p>The mob now reigned in Baltimore. Gun-shops were plundered.
Other shops were closed. The President was notified that no more
troops could pass through the city, unless they fought their way. That
night the bridges on the railroad to Philadelphia were burnt, so that
this great avenue was closed.<a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>On the 21st of April, the Third Battalion of Massachusetts Rifles,
with Hon. Charles Devens as Major, consisting of two hundred and
sixty-six men, arrived at New York from Worcester, on their way to
the scene of action, and quartered in the armory of the famous New
York Seventh, which had left on the preceding afternoon. On a visit
to the armory by Mr. Sumner, the Battalion was called into line, and
he made the following remarks.</p>

</div>

<hr class="tb" />

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Major Devens, Soldiers, and Fellow-Citizens of
Massachusetts</span>:&mdash;</p>

<p class="dropcap">Being in New York, on my way home from Washington
to our beloved Massachusetts, and learning
that you also were here on your way to duty, I have
called, that I might have the privilege of looking upon
your faces. [<i>Cheers.</i>] Your commanding officer, whom
I have known long in other walks of life, does me the
honor of inviting me to say a few words. If I have
yielded, it is because he is irresistible, for I feel in my
soul that action, and not speech, is needed now. [<i>Cheers.</i>]
Elsewhere it has been my part to speak. It is your
part now to act. [<i>Applause.</i>] Nor do I doubt that
you will act as becomes the Commonwealth that has
committed to you her name. [<i>Cheers.</i>]</p>

<p>I cannot see before me so large a number of the sons
of Massachusetts, already moving to the scene of trial,
without feeling anew the loss we have just encountered:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
I allude to the death, at Baltimore, of devoted fellow-citizens,
who had sprung forward so promptly at the
call of country. As I heard that they had fallen, my
soul was touched. And yet, when I thought of the
cause for which they met death, I said to myself, that,
for the sake of Massachusetts, ay, and for their own
sake, I would not have it otherwise. [<i>Enthusiastic applause.</i>]
They have died well, for they died at the post
of duty, and so dying have become an example and a
name in history, while Massachusetts, that sent them
forth, adds new memories to a day already famous in
her calendar, and links the present with the past. It
was on the 19th of April that they died, and their
blood was the first offering of patriotism in the great
cause which snatched them from the avocations of
peace. Thus have they passed at once into companionship
with those forefathers who on the 19th of
April, 1775, made also the offering of their blood.
[<i>Loud cheers.</i>] Lexington is not alone. As on that
historic field, Massachusetts blood is again the first to
be spilled, and in a conflict which is but a continuation
of the other; and these dying volunteers have
placed Massachusetts once more foremost, as on that
morning which heralded Independence. [<i>Cheers.</i>] Therefore
I would not have it otherwise. [<i>Cheers.</i>] Nor do I
doubt that the day we now deplore will be followed, as
was that earlier day, by certain triumph. [<i>Cheers.</i>]</p>

<p>Those other times, when our forefathers struggled for
Independence against the British power, were often said
“to try men’s souls”; and these words are yet repeated
to depict those trials. But, witnessing the willingness
and alacrity with which patriot citizens now offer themselves
for country, and to die, if need be, I look in vain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
for signs that souls are tried. [<i>Cheers.</i>] And yet I
cannot disguise from you, soldiers, that there are hardships
and perils in your path. But what is victory, unless
through hardship and peril? [<i>Cheers.</i>] Be brave,
then, and do the duty to which you are called; and if
you need any watchword, let it be, <em>Massachusetts</em>, <span class="smcap">the
Constitution</span>, and FREEDOM! [<i>Loud applause from
the soldiers.</i>]</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>On the same evening, the Battalion embarked on board the transport
“Ariel” for Annapolis, where it arrived on the morning of April
24th, and on the 2d of May was transferred to Fort McHenry, in the
harbor of Baltimore. There it remained to the end of its term of
service.</p>

<p>The question of Passports for Colored Citizens was embarrassed by
the Dred Scott decision, and the usage of the State Department, refusing
to recognize colored persons as citizens. The position of the
latter was set forth in a letter of Mr. Thomas, Assistant Secretary,
communicating the judgment of Mr. Marcy, Secretary of State.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="right medium">“<span class="smcap">Department of State, Washington</span>, November 4, 1856.</p>

<p>“Your letters of the 29th ult. and 3d inst., requesting passports for eleven
colored persons, have been received, and I am directed by the Secretary to
inform you that the papers transmitted by you do not warrant the Department
in complying with your request. The question whether free negroes
are citizens is not now presented for the first time, but has repeatedly arisen
in the administration of both the National and State governments. In 1821
a controversy arose as to whether free persons of color were citizens of the
United States, within the intent and meaning of the Acts of Congress regulating
foreign and coasting trade, so as to be qualified to command vessels,
and Wirt, Attorney-General, decided that they were not, and he moreover
held that the words ‘citizens of the United States’ were used in the Acts
of Congress in the same sense as in the Constitution. This view is also fully
sustained in a recent opinion of the present Attorney-General.</p>

<p>“The judicial decisions of the country are to the same effect.… Such
being the construction of the Constitution in regard to free persons of color,
it is conceived that they cannot be regarded, when beyond the jurisdiction
of this Government, as entitled to the full rights of citizens; but the Secretary
directs me to say, that, though the Department could not certify that
such persons are citizens of the United States, yet, if satisfied of the truth of
the facts, it would give a certificate that they were born in the United
States, are free, and that the Government thereof would regard it to be its
duty to protect them, if wronged by a foreign government while within its
jurisdiction for a legal and proper purpose.”<a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Amidst the general anxieties of the time this important question
was presented for revision. A colored youth of Boston, son of Robert
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>Morris, Esq., a practitioner in the courts of Massachusetts, unable to
obtain a college education at home, proposed to seek it in France,
where there was no exclusion on account of color, and Mr. Sumner, in
a written communication to the Secretary of State, requested a passport
for him, at the same time inclosing the description of his person
duly authenticated, in which his complexion was said to be “colored”
and his hair “short and curly.” There being some delay, Mr. Sumner
called at the Department to urge personally his formal application.
Mr. Seward did not like to issue a passport on the description furnished,
but at the same time would furnish a passport to Mr. Sumner
for anybody whom he certified to be a citizen, without description.
The authenticated description was then returned, and Mr. Sumner,
at Mr. Seward’s own desk, and on the ordinary despatch paper of
the Department, wrote at once the following.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>July 4th, 1861, Congress met in extraordinary session, at the call
of the President, to make provision for the welfare of the country, and
especially for the prosecution of the war. Meanwhile, Mr. Crittenden,
so famous for his attempt at Compromise, had ceased to be a Senator,
but he had become a member of the other House. Here he introduced
a resolution, declaring the object of the war, which was adopted by the
House with only two dissenting votes.</p>

<p>July 24, the same resolution, in nearly the same words, was introduced
into the Senate by Hon. Andrew Johnson, of Tennessee, afterwards
President, who pressed a vote at once, even without having it
printed. On Mr. Sumner’s objection it was postponed. His few words
in making this objection have significance, as showing his feeling towards
Mr. Johnson at that time, and also his unwillingness that the
Senate should commit itself hastily to a proposition which, under the
name of the “Crittenden Resolution,” was destined to play an important
part.</p>

I hesitate, therefore, to use the privilege, under

introduction; but I do think, in view of its importance,
that it ought at least to be printed, so that we may
have an opportunity of reading it carefully and considering
it well, before we act upon it. Therefore I object
to its consideration at this time. I wish the Senator to
understand that it is with great respect for himself, an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>d

requires. I hope the Senator himself will consent that
it lie on the table and be printed.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>Mr. Johnson said that he would not object, and the resolution was
ordered to be printed, as follows.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<i>Resolved</i>,&mdash;That the present deplorable civil war has been forced upon
the country by the disunionists of the Southern States, now in revolt against
the Constitutional Government, and in arms around the capital; that in
this national emergency, Congress, banishing all feeling of mere passion or
resentment, will recollect only its duty to the whole country; that this war
is not prosecuted upon our part in any spirit of oppression, nor for any purpose
of conquest or subjugation, nor for the purpose of overthrowing or interfering
with the rights or established institutions of those States, but to
defend and maintain the supremacy of the Constitution, and all laws made
in pursuance thereof, and to preserve the Union, with all the dignity, equality,
and rights of the several States unimpaired; that as soon as these objects
are accomplished, the war ought to cease.”</p>

</div>

<p>The next day the resolution was taken up, on motion of Mr. Johnson.
Mr. Trumbull objected to the allegation in it that the disunionists
were “in arms around the capital,” which in his opinion was not
true; and he added, that, in his opinion, the revolt was occasioned by
people who are not here or in this vicinity: it was started in South
Carolina. He objected also to the clause that the war was “not prosecuted
for any purpose of conquest or subjugation,”&mdash;on which he said,
“I trust this war <em>is</em> prosecuted for the purpose of subjugating all rebels
and traitors who are in arms against the Government.” For these
reasons he voted in the negative. Every other Republican present
voted in the affirmative, except Mr. Sumner, who declined to vote.
His name does not appear in the record.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>This resolution was general in terms, but specious. Though not
mentioning Slavery expressly, or interfering with the requirement of
military necessity, it was considered at the time as a safeguard of Slavery,
even to the Fugitive Slave Bill itself, which was included under
the words, “the supremacy of the Constitution, and all laws made in
pursuance thereof.” Nor could it be forgotten that it was first brought
forward by the same person who, during the previous winter, as Senator
from Kentucky, had most pertinaciously urged an odious compromise,
by which Slavery was to be intrenched in the Constitution, and
made dominant in the National Government. Mr. Sumner, always
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>sensitive to any recognition of Slavery, saw in it an effort to commit
Congress the wrong way, so that inaction on Slavery should be the
policy of the war, when, to his mind, the sooner Slavery was attacked,
the better. His objection to the resolution was radical; but, unwilling
to separate openly from political associates, anxious also with regard
to the President, who held back, and hoping that time would
bring general concurrence in striking at Slavery, he was silent, and
contented himself by withholding his vote, so that he was not committed
to the resolution in any respect.</p>

<p>This statement is made to explain the progress of events, and also
because Mr. Sumner’s course was the occasion of comment, and even of
hostile criticism, at the time.</p>

<p class="plabeln"><span class="smcap">Speech in the Senate, against Increase of Ten per Cent on
all Foreign Duties, July 29, 1861.</span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/line.png" width="80" height="16" alt="" />
</div>

<div class="medium">

<p>In the consideration of the Tariff Bill at this session, Mr. Sumner
differed from friends on some of the points involved. One of these
differences occurred on his motion, July 29, 1861, to strike out the following
clause:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“That, in addition to the duties now imposed by law on goods, wares,
and merchandise not enumerated in the foregoing section, and on all goods
not herein otherwise provided for, hereafter imported from foreign countries,
there shall be levied, collected, and paid <em>a duty of ten per centum ad valorem,
to include all merchandise subject to or exempt from duty by former laws</em>.”</p>

</div>

<p>On this motion he spoke as follows.</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">MR. PRESIDENT,&mdash;I think we had better take a
vote on the simple proposition, because in that
way we shall arrive at the precise wishes of the Senate.
I therefore move to strike out the words just read; and
if I can have the attention of the Senate for two minutes,
I think I can explain why they should be stricken
out.</p>

<p>It will be remembered that in the latter days of the
last session a new tariff was adopted; but, owing to the
disturbed state of the country, and the impediments to
commerce, it is not too much to say that we have no
present experience of its operation. We do not know
to what extent it will supply revenue. While thus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
ignorant of its operation, it is proposed to make an important
change, being nothing less than to pile another
story upon what is already criticised as too high. In
addition to all existing duties, we are asked to impose a
further duty of ten per cent. In the present exigencies
of the country, if there were reasonable assurance that
out of such extraordinary tax the revenue would be
advanced, I should have nothing to say against it,&mdash;on
the contrary, I should hold up both hands for it;
but, so far as I am informed,&mdash;and I have taken pains
to inform myself,&mdash;there is no reasonable ground to
believe that the addition of ten per cent extra upon
present duties would yield any additional revenue.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Polk.</span> If the Senator will allow me to interrupt
him&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> Certainly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Polk.</span> I will ask if the result of his investigations
is not that the addition of ten per cent would actually decrease
the revenue?</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> The Senator properly directs attention
to an important point. I said there was no reasonable
assurance that there would be an increase of revenue.
I believe that I may go further, as the Senator has suggested,
and say that a tariff so far prohibitory will actually
diminish instead of increasing revenue. Where
then will be your revenue? Revenue comes from commerce,
and is just in proportion to the extent of commerce;
but if you make commerce impossible, where is
your revenue? You kill the bird that lays the golden
egg.</p>

<p>There is a pleasant story, which I remember to have
heard, of a shopkeeper who once announced to his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
friends that before breakfast he had increased his fortune
by ten per cent; but, on inquiry, it was ascertained
that he had merely marked his goods on hand at an increased
price of ten per cent, and that was his boasted
increase. I much fear that this additional ten per cent
will be equally vain for the increase of our national
revenue.</p>

<p>But, Mr. President, while the advantages of this proposed
increase are all uncertain, there are disadvantages
that are certain. It will add to the bad name which,
unhappily, the tariff of the last session has already
with those disposed to criticise it, and especially with
foreign countries. At this moment, when every suggestion
of prudence dictates that in our relations with
foreign countries we should be governed by a supreme
policy of moderation, conciliation, and good-will, you
propose to take a step which, to say the least of it,
will be regarded as indicative of hostility or of indifference.
Now, whatever may be the sentiments and the
feelings of European Governments with regard to us,
it is perfectly clear that the laboring classes of Europe
do sympathize with us in our present struggle; and
all those sympathies you turn aside, when you impose
prohibitory duties which cut off a market for their
labor. I am therefore, Mr. President, opposed to this
increase on two positive grounds: first, because its advantages
are uncertain; secondly, because its disadvantages
are certain.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>Mr. Fessenden replied, saying, among other things,&mdash;</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I am very glad that the Senator has made the remarks
he has, and I desire to say a few words in reply, more particularly
to the last portion of his speech. As Chairman of
the Committee on Foreign Relations, it being his duty to
keep on the best possible terms with all foreign powers, he
had a right, perhaps, to say what he has said; but, after all,
that is not the question. I would suggest to the honorable
Senator, that there is something else to be considered, at
the present time, besides the good or bad opinion which
certain foreign ministers and others may have of our domestic
policy.”</p>

</div>

<p>Then again:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Now the Senator says: ‘Be careful how you lay these
duties on, because foreign countries will be offended at us.’
What right has a foreign country to make any question
about what we choose to do with reference to these matters,&mdash;to
say, when we are in a state of war, and struggling
for national existence even, that we shall not impose duties
which are necessary to enable us to prosecute that war, because,
forsooth, it may affect the interests of foreign gentlemen?”</p>

</div>

<p>Here Mr. Sumner interposed:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p>I know the Senator does not intend to misstate my
argument. I assumed that there would be no increase
of revenue from this additional ten per cent,&mdash;at least,
that the advantages of the increase were uncertain,
doubtful; and then that it was very certain there would
be disadvantages.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>Mr. Fessenden continued at some length, and with much earnestness
said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I have heard this argument adduced out of doors, and
this talk about how foreign powers might feel respecting the
duties we choose to impose upon articles imported into this
country. Why, Sir, I say the argument is nothing less
than an insult.… I say, therefore, that no people have a
right to be offended with us for acting according to our own
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>views of our own interests. They would not have it in time
of peace, and much less could they have it in time of war.”</p>

</div>

<p>Mr. Sumner restated his position.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. President</span>,&mdash;The Senator and myself are perfectly
agreed in our main object. Here there is no
difference between us. Each desires to secure the largest
revenue. For myself, I know no bounds to this
desire. The simple question is, How will this be best
accomplished? The Senator puts forward the proposition
to increase by ten per cent all existing duties, and
he does this while still ignorant of the actual working
of the tariff established in March. To our inexperience
with regard to that tariff he would add further inexperience
with regard to the effect of the proposed increase.
Now this may be good policy; but it does not
seem so to me. The commerce of the country cannot
bear such constant change, especially in the direction
proposed. The revenue will not gain by it.</p>

<p>For good or for evil, what is familiarly known as
the “Morrill Tariff” has been adopted. The commerce
of the country has taken note of its requisitions, and is
now ready to govern itself accordingly. And it seems
to me that the House of Representatives acted wisely,
in seeking to increase the revenue by duties on selected
articles, which it was thought could bear the tax, rather
than by wholesale change, which must cause the
whole system to be remodelled. In this respect the
House bill has an advantage over that brought forward
by the Senator from Rhode Island [Mr. <span class="smcap">Simmons</span>] and
maintained so zealously by the Senator from Maine
[Mr. <span class="smcap">Fessenden</span>].</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span></p>
<p>But the Senator from Maine says he is unwilling to
hearken to suggestions from foreign nations.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Fessenden.</span> Not at all. I said no such thing as
that. I am perfectly willing to hearken to all suggestions,
if they are respectfully made, and do not assume a right to
dictate to us.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> Pray, who has dictated to us, or who
assumes any such right? And as to suggestions, which
the Senator says he welcomes, I am not aware that any
foreign nation, or any person representing any foreign
nation, has made even a suggestion that could come
within the criticism, swift as it is, of the Senator. Nor,
indeed, am I aware of any suggestion in any form to
this body. Surely the Senator is mistaken. He must
in his imagination exaggerate something that he has
heard; or perhaps he misinterprets something that fell
from myself.</p>

<p>Let me not be misunderstood. I have said that this
ten per cent proposition, if adopted, will give your
tariff a bad name among those who are disposed to
criticise it, and especially with foreign countries. Was
I not right? Is it not true? Willingly I take the
censure of the Senator, while I strive at this moment
to secure for my country sympathy from every quarter,
even from foreign nations; nor shall I be disturbed by
anything which fell from the Senator. I am accustomed
to criticism in this body. And I beg to say that
I shrink from no responsibility which belongs to my
position. If duty requires that foreign nations should
be encountered by a policy harassing to their industry,
I shall take my full share of this grave responsibility;
but until I see the path of duty in that direction, I
hope that I may be pardoned, if I prefer a policy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
doubly commended as most beneficial to us and least
hurtful to them.</p>

<p>I am unwilling that my country at this moment
should pursue a shadow, and in the end find that it has
gained nothing but ill-will. Strong as we are, we cannot
afford to augment the odium created by our late
tariff. Better husband our resources,&mdash;among which I
place the sympathies of the civilized world, and of those
laboring classes whose industry must suffer by your act,
without, I fear, any corresponding benefit to us.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>The amendment of Mr. Sumner was lost.</p>

<hr class="r15" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>This speech, at the time of its delivery, was entitled in some quarters
“Emancipation the Cure of the Rebellion,” which certainly
showed an appreciation of its meaning. In the pamphlet edition another
title was adopted, argumentative in form, and intended to suggest
the same conclusion,&mdash;“Union and Peace, how they shall be restored.”
It was made at the annual State Convention of the Republican
party of Massachusetts.</p>

<p>The Convention was called to order by Hon. William Claflin, Chairman
of the Republican State Committee. Its permanent organization
was as follows.</p>

<p>President,&mdash;Hon. Henry L. Dawes, of North Adams.</p>

<p>Vice-Presidents,&mdash;Richard Libbey of Wellfleet, James H. Mitchell
of East Bridgewater, Joseph N. Bacon of Newton, Albert J. Wright
of Boston, Nehemiah Boynton of Chelsea, John S. E. Rogers of Gloucester,
Gerry W. Cochrane of Methuen, N. C. Munson of Shirley,
Giles H. Whitney of Winchendon, J. H. Butler of Northampton, Joel
Hayden of Haydensville, by districts; with Robert M. Hooper of
Boston, Oliver Ames, Jr., of Easton, Alexander DeWitt of Oxford,
Hapgood Swift of Lowell, Freeman Walker of North Brookfield, Marshall
P. Wilder of Dorchester, Clement Willis of Boston, Lorenzo
Sabine of Roxbury, Thomas Tucker of Worcester, Francis H. Fay of
Lancaster, Columbus Tyler of Somerville, George Washington Warren
of Charlestown, Linus Beck of Boston, Charles O. Rogers of Boston,
H. B. Staples of Milford, Orlando Burt of Sandisfield, Francis Coggswell
of Andover, at large.</p>

<p>Secretaries,&mdash;S. N. Stockwell of Boston, J. E. Tucker of Worcester,
N. A. Horton of Salem, Z. E. Stowe of Lowell, George S. Merrill of
Lawrence, Joseph B. Thaxter of Hingham, Samuel B. Noyes of Canton,
William S. Robinson of Malden, Charles A. Chase of Boston,
L. H. Bradford of Fitchburg, William Martin of North Adams, Gardner
M. Fiske of Palmer, William W. Clapp, Jr., of Boston.</p>

<p>The President, on being conducted to the chair, made a speech, in
which he said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Since last assembled here for a kindred purpose, the mighty march of
events has borne the popular efforts on to a higher plane than ever before
opened to the gaze of man.… Massachusetts cannot, if she would, and,
thank God, she would not, if she could, perform an indifferent part in this
life struggle of the Republic. She makes no boast over her sister States,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>but the great Disposer and Adjuster of events has placed her in the forefront
rank, in this great battle for the integrity of the nation and the existence
of free institutions, and she accepts her place with alacrity.”</p>

</div>

<p>Immediately after this speech, John A. Andrew was unanimously
and by acclamation renominated as candidate for Governor, being his
second nomination for that post. The committees of the Convention
having been appointed, there was an adjournment till afternoon.</p>

<p>In the afternoon, the resolutions of the Committee, seven in number,
were reported by George S. Hale, of Boston, and at once laid upon
the table, on motion of Edward L. Pierce, of Milton, in order to give
an opportunity for Mr. Sumner to address the Convention. A report
says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Hon. Charles Sumner came on the platform about this time, and his
presence was acknowledged with great applause. The President introduced
him to the Convention, and he made a speech about an hour
long.”</p>

</div>

<p>“Great enthusiasm” and “warm cheers” are the terms of other
reports with regard to his reception. These are mentioned because
the sentiments of the audience were represented afterwards as adverse.
The pamphlet report says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Upon the appearance of Mr. Sumner on the platform, he was most
cordially greeted by the whole Convention and the large audience in the
galleries. Hon. H. L. Dawes, President of the Convention, introduced him
in a few felicitous words, whereupon the warm applause of the vast assembly
burst forth again with great enthusiasm, ending with three rousing
cheers.”</p>

</div>

<p>At the conclusion of Mr. Sumner’s speech, a motion was made to
take the resolutions of the Committee from the table, when Rev.
James Freeman Clarke, the Liberal preacher and sincere reformer,
appeared on the platform, and after a few remarks offered the following
resolutions.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<i>Resolved</i>, That, while the people of Massachusetts have confidence in the
wisdom of the National Administration, and are ready hereafter, as hitherto,
to give their blood and their treasure in answer to its call, yet, believing that
Slavery is the root and cause of this Rebellion, they will rejoice when the
time shall come, in the wisdom of the Government, to remove this radical
source of our present evils.</p>

<p>“<i>Resolved</i>, That, when the proper time shall arrive, the people of Massachusetts
will welcome any act, under the war power of the Commander-in-Chief,
which shall declare all the slaves within the lines of our armies to be
free, and accept their services in defence of the Union,&mdash;compensating all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>loyal owners for slaves thus emancipated, and thus carrying liberty for all
human beings wherever the Stars and Stripes shall float.”</p>

</div>

<p>There was no direct vote on these resolutions, but authentic accounts
at the time enable us to trace their fortune.</p>

<p>They were at once opposed by George S. Hale, the reporter of the
Committee’s resolutions, and by Artemas Lee of Templeton, “declaring
that they were calculated to weaken the Administration in Kentucky.”
Not being moved as an amendment to the other resolutions, the first
question was on the adoption of the latter, which were carried. Pending
the question on Mr. Clarke’s resolutions, the Committee to nominate
Lieutenant-Governor, Secretary of the Commonwealth, Attorney-General,
Treasurer and Receiver-General, and Auditor, made their
report, which superseded the other question, and caused an irritating
and personal discussion. When the nominations were completed, it
had become late, and many had already left by the trains, among them
Mr. Sumner; but Mr. Clarke moved to take his resolutions from the
table, when, according to the report, “a member in front of the chair
moved to adjourn, and that motion, being first in order, was put and
carried, with but few dissenting votes.” It was supposed by many,
that, had a vote been taken on these resolutions while the Convention
was full, they would have been adopted.</p>

<p>In the disposition to weaken the speech of Mr. Sumner, it was
charged at the time that he spoke without official invitation,&mdash;which
was contrary to the fact. Some time in advance of the Convention,
Mr. Claflin, Chairman of the State Committee, called on Mr.
Sumner and invited him to address it, urging him strongly; and
when the latter said that he could not consent, without declaring the
duty of Emancipation, and freeing his mind on this all-important subject,
Mr. Claflin insisted that he should do so, and Mr. Sumner
promised to speak. At another call Mr. Sumner read to Mr. Claflin
a sketch of what he proposed to say, adding that he would not speak
except with the approval of Mr. Claflin, when the latter declared his
entire agreement with Mr. Sumner, and insisted that the speech should
be made.</p>

<p>An account of the contemporaneous discussion, whether of criticism
or sympathy, will be found in the Appendix.</p>

<h3>SPEECH.</h3>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/line.png" width="80" height="16" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">FELLOW-CITIZENS,&mdash;In meeting fellow-citizens
of Massachusetts, who have come together from
all parts of the Commonwealth, I find myself in a familiar
scene, but plainly things are changed. Yes,
there is a great change, and it is manifest in our
Convention.</p>

<p>No longer are we met, as so often in times past, on
questions of controversy, or to sustain our cause by argument.
That hour has passed. Formerly I have exhibited
to you the atrocities of the Fugitive Slave Bill;
I have rejoiced to show that Freedom was National and
Slavery Sectional; I have striven to prevent the spread
of Slavery in the Territories; I have vindicated especially
Freedom in Kansas, assailed by slaveholding conspirators;
I have exposed the tyrannical usurpations of
the Slave Oligarchy; and I have dragged into light the
huge and hideous Barbarism of Slavery. [<i>Applause.</i>]
But these topics have passed into history, and are no
longer of practical interest. They are not of to-day.</p>

<p>Let us rejoice that at least so much is gained, and
from the extent of present triumph take hope and courage
for the future. Providence will be with the good
cause in times to come, as in times past. Others may
despair; I do not. Others may see gloom; I cannot.
Others may hesitate; I will not. [<i>Applause.</i>] Already
is the nation saved. Great as seems the present peril,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
there was peril greater far, while it was sinking year
after year under the rule of Slavery. How often have
I exclaimed, in times past, that our foremost object was
the Emancipation of the National Government, so that
no longer should it be the slave of Slavery, ready to do
its bidding in all things! But this surpassing victory
has been won. It was won first by the ballot-box,
when Abraham Lincoln was elected President of the
United States [<i>applause</i>]; and it was won the second
time by the cartridge-box, when, at the command of the
President, the guns of Fort Sumter returned defiance to
the Rebel artillery. [<i>Three cheers.</i>] Such is the madness
of Slavery that the first was not enough; unhappily,
the second was needed to complete the work.</p>

<p>God be praised, much is already done. The Slave
Oligarchy, which, according to vaunt of a slaveholding
Senator, has ruled the Republic for more than fifty years,&mdash;which
has stamped its degrading character upon the
national forehead,&mdash;which has entered into and possessed
not only the politics, but the literature, and even the religion
of the land,&mdash;which has embroiled us at home, and
given us a bad name abroad,&mdash;which has wielded at will
President, Cabinet, and even judicial tribunals,&mdash;which
has superseded Public Opinion by substituting its own
immoral behests,&mdash;which has appropriated to itself the
offices and honors of the Republic,&mdash;which has established
Slavery as the single test and shibboleth of favor,&mdash;which,
after opening all our Territories to this wrong,
was already promising to renew the Slave-Trade and
its unutterable woes,&mdash;nay, more, which, in the instinct
of that tyranny through which it ruled, was beating
down all safeguard of human rights, freedom of
speech, freedom of the press, security of person, and delivering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
the whole country to a sway whose vulgarity
was second only to its madness,&mdash;this domineering Slave
Oligarchy is dislodged from the National Government,
never more to return. [<i>Immense sensation.</i>] Thus far,
at least, has Emancipation prevailed. <em>The greatest slave
of all is free.</em></p>

<p>If at any moment we are disposed to be disheartened,
if the Future is not always clear before us, we
may find ample motive for joy in the victory already
achieved. Pillars greater than those of Hercules might
fitly mark this progress.</p>

<p>Among the obvious results of such victory is one to
be enjoyed especially on this occasion. It is Slavery
which has been the origin of our party divisions, keeping
men asunder who ought to act together. But with
the expulsion of this disturber the apology for difference
ceases. All patriots, all who truly love their
country, may now act together,&mdash;no matter in what
party combination they have appeared, no matter of
what accent the speech by which their present duties
are declared. Call them Democrats, Union men, natives,
or foreigners, what you will, are we not all engaged
in a common cause? Nor will I claim as yet
the highest praise for those with whom I am most intimately
associated. I have read history too well not
to remember that faithful allies are sometimes superior
even to domestic veterans. Hannibal relied less on his
own Carthaginians than on his Spanish infantry and
Numidian horse.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The Government is assailed by a rebellion without
precedent. Never, since Satan warred upon the Almighty,
has rebellion assumed such a front [<i>applause</i>],<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
and never before has it begun in such a cause. The
Rebels are numerous and powerful, and their cause is
Slavery. [<i>Sensation.</i>]</p>

<p>It is the very essence of rebellion to be audacious,
unhesitating, unscrupulous. Rebellion sticks at nothing,&mdash;least
of all, rebellion beginning in Slavery. It
can be encountered successfully only by vigor and
energy surpassing its own. Patriotism as a motive
surely is not less potent than Treason. It must be invoked.
By all the memories of your fathers, who
founded this Republic and delivered to you the precious
heritage, by all the sentiments of gratitude for
the good you have enjoyed beneath its protecting care,
are you summoned to its defence. Defence did I say?
With mortification I utter the word; but you all know
the truth.</p>

<p>Rebel conspirators have set upon us, and now besiege
the National Government. They besiege it at
Washington, where are the President and his Cabinet
with the national archives. They besiege it at Fortress
Monroe on the Atlantic, at St. Louis on the Mississippi,
and now they besiege it in Kentucky. Everywhere
we are on the defensive. [<i>Sensation.</i>] Strongholds
are wrested from us. Soldiers gathered under
the folds of the national flag are compelled to surrender.
Citizens, whose only offence is loyalty, are driven from
their homes. Bridges are burned. Railways are disabled.
Steamers and ships are seized. The largest
navy-yard of the country is appropriated. Commerce
is hunted on the sea, and property, wherever it can be
reached, ruthlessly robbed or destroyed. Only within
a few days we have read the order of one Buckner,
Rebel commander in Kentucky, directing the destruction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
of a most important lock, by which Green River
was rendered navigable. Pardon me, if I ask attention
to this intercepted order. It is instructive, as showing
the spirit with which we have to deal.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="right medium">“<span class="smcap">Bowling Green</span>, September 19, 1861.</p>

<p>“Lock No. 1 must be destroyed. I rely upon our friends
at Owenboro’ to do it. Not an hour must be lost. The
destruction is a great deal to me in crippling our adversary.
Assemble our friends, without delay, in sufficient force to
accomplish the object. One of the best ways is to open all
the gates but one, and to dig down behind the wall at both
gates, to put one or two kegs of powder behind the wall, to
apply a slow match, and blow the wall into the lock. If
possible, it should be done in such a way as to leave a
strong current through the lock, which will empty the
dam. Provide everything in advance. Do not fail. It is
worth an effort.”<a name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a></p>

</div>

<p>It is still doubtful if the work of destruction was
accomplished. But the military order remains. Thus
madly was it attempted to sweep away the most valuable
of the internal improvements of Kentucky, being
part of the pride and wealth of the State.</p>

<p>Do you ask in whose name all this is done? The
answer is easy. Not “in the name of God and the
Continental Congress,” as Ethan Allen summoned Ticonderoga,&mdash;but
“in the name of Slavery.” In the
name of Slavery, and nothing else, is all this crime,
destruction, and ravage perpetrated; and the work still
proceeds.</p>

<p>Look at the war as you will, and you always see
Slavery,&mdash;as the renowned orator of Rome saw in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
evil about him only the great conspirator. Never were
his words more applicable: <i>Nullum facinus exstitit, nisi
per te; nullum flagitium sine te</i>: “No villany but has
owed its existence to thee; no shameful thing has been
done without thee.”<a name="FNanchor_149_149" id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> Slavery is our Catiline, being to
this war everything,&mdash;inspiration, motive power, end
and aim, be-all and end-all. And this brings me to an
important statement.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It is often said that war will make an end of Slavery.
This is probable. But it is surer still that the
overthrow of Slavery will make an end of the war.
[<i>Tumultuous applause and cheers.</i>]</p>

<p>If I am correct in this averment, which I believe
beyond question, then do reason, justice, and policy
unite, each and all, in declaring that the war must be
brought to bear directly on the grand conspirator and
omnipresent enemy. [<i>Here the vociferous cheers of the
Convention interrupted the speaker.</i>] Not to do so is
to take upon ourselves all the weakness of Slavery,
while we leave to the Rebels its boasted resources of
military strength. [<i>Cheers.</i>] Not to do so is to squander
life and treasure in a vain masquerade of battle,
without practical result. Not to do so is blindly to neglect
the plainest dictates of economy, humanity, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
common sense,&mdash;and, alas! simply to let slip the
dogs of war on a mad chase over the land, never to
stop until spent with fatigue or sated with slaughter.
[<i>Sensation.</i>]</p>

<p>Believe me, fellow-citizens, I know all imagined difficulties
and unquestioned responsibilities. But, if you
are in earnest, the difficulties will at once disappear,
and the responsibilities are such as you will gladly
bear. This is not the first time that a knot hard to
untie was cut by the sword [<i>cheers</i>]; and we all know
that danger flees before the brave man. Believe that
you can, and you can. The will only is needed. Courage
now is the highest prudence. [<i>Applause.</i>]</p>

<p>It is not necessary even, borrowing a familiar phrase,
to carry the war into Africa. It will be enough, if
we carry Africa into the war [<i>here the outburst of applause
compelled the speaker to suspend his remarks</i>],
in any form, any quantity, any way. [<i>Continued applause.</i>]
The moment this is done, Rebellion will begin
its bad luck, and the Union become secure forever.
[<i>Cheers.</i>]</p>

<p>History teaches by examples. The occasion does not
allow me to show how completely this monitor points
our duty and certain triumph. I content myself with
two instances of special mark,&mdash;one from ancient
Greece, and the other from ancient Rome.</p>

<p>The most fatal day for ancient Greece was that “dishonest
victory” at Chæronea, when Philip of Macedon
triumphed over combined forces, in which Demosthenes
was enlisted as a soldier. The panic was universal.
Athens was thrown into consternation. Her great orator
had fought bravely, but ineffectually. Another orator,
called by Milton “that old man eloquent,” died<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
suddenly on hearing the report of the defeat. The
Book of Fate seemed about to close, while the proud
Athenian State sank to be a Macedonian province.
Then it was that a patriot orator, Hyperides, launched
a proposition to emancipate the slaves. The effect was
electric. The royal Philip, already strong in victory,
trembled. King and conqueror, he was statesman also,
and saw well that such a proposition, begun in Athens,
would shake all Greece, even to his powerful throne,
which the young Alexander was preparing to mount.
His triumphant course was arrested, and peace secured.<a name="FNanchor_150_150" id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a></p>

<p>The other instance is in Roman history. You will
find it in Plutarch’s Life of Caius Marius. Six times
Consul,&mdash;victor over the redoubtable Jugurtha, also
over the innumerable Teutones and Cimbri,&mdash;hailed as
Saviour of Rome, and then, in the terrible vicissitudes
of civil feud, driven from his country to find shelter in
the ruins of Carthage,&mdash;this great general, returning
from exile, was able to effect a landing in Italy. The
incident is recorded in these words,&mdash;and you must
acknowledge that such immense military experience
gives to the example highest authority:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Marius upon this news determined to hasten to Cinna.
He took with him some Marusian horse which he had levied
in Africa, and a few others that were come to him from Italy,
in all not amounting to above a thousand men, and with
this handful began his voyage. He arrived at a port of
Tuscany called Telamon, <em>and as soon as he was landed proclaimed
liberty to the slaves</em>. [<i>Immense applause.</i>] The name
of Marius brought down numbers of freemen too, husbandmen,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>shepherds, and such like, to the shore, the ablest of
which he enlisted, and in a short time had a great army on
foot, with which he filled forty ships.”<a name="FNanchor_151_151" id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Thus far Plutarch. It is needless to add that Marius
soon found himself master of Rome. [<i>Applause.</i>]</p>

<p>These are historic instances. I do not adduce them
for blind acceptance, but simply that you may see
how in times past defeat was stayed and victory won
by a generous word for Freedom. Men die and disappear;
but the Human Family continues the same, in
passions and fears, as when Philip was frightened back
from Athens, as when Marius was borne in triumph to
Rome. [<i>Applause.</i>]</p>

<p>To these great teachers I would add the authority
of the ancient Roman Law, and I refer you for it to the
common Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities<a name="FNanchor_152_152" id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a>
now used in all our schools. According to that law,
the state of Slavery might be terminated in at least
three different modes: first, by manumission; secondly,
by enactment of reward to the slave; and, thirdly, <em>by
enactment of punishment to the master</em>. [<i>Great sensation.</i>]
If the master failed to be a good citizen, he
might be punished, so that he should suffer in property,
and at the same time others gain what is more
than property,&mdash;freedom. But I do not cite even this
example of a time-honored jurisprudence for absolute
guidance. I will not doubt, that, in the unparalleled
circumstances by which we are encompassed, justice
will be done.</p>

<p>Already the way is easy. A simple declaration,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>that all men within the lines of the United States
troops are freemen, will be in strict conformity with
the Constitution, and also with precedent. The Constitution
knows no man as slave. It treats all within
its jurisdiction as <em>persons</em>, while the exceptional provision
for the rendition of <em>persons</em> held to service or
labor, you will observe, is carefully confined to such as
have escaped into another State,&mdash;so that in Virginia it
cannot require the surrender of a Virginia slave, nor in
Missouri of a Missouri slave. It is clear, therefore, that
there is no sanction under the Constitution for turning
a national camp into a slave-pen, or for turning military
officers into slave-hunters. Let this plain construction
be adopted, and then, as our lines advance,
Freedom will be established everywhere, and the national
flag in its triumphant march will wave with new
glory. [<i>Applause.</i>]</p>

<p>A brave General whom Massachusetts has given to
the country, though commencing his career with prejudices
derived from the Proslavery school of politicians,
has known how to see this question in its true
light: I mean, of course, General Butler. [<i>Immense
cheering, interrupting the speaker for some time.</i>] He has
declared, in a letter to the Secretary of War, dated Fortress
Monroe, 30th July, 1861, with reference to fugitive
slaves, that it is his duty to “take the same care of
these men, women, and children, houseless, homeless,
and unprovided for, as he would of the same number
of men, women, and children who for their attachment
to the Union had been driven or allowed to flee from
the Confederate States.”<a name="FNanchor_153_153" id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> These words are better for
his reputation than a victory. [<i>Applause and cheers.</i>]<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
Humanity and wisdom go together, and here we see
both.</p>

<p>There is similar and unimpeachable testimony from
a succession of Generals, all born, living, and dying in
the South: I mean Gaines, Taylor, and Jesup, who,
one after another, commanded in that protracted war
instigated by the Slave Power against the Seminoles,
and waged at such cost of treasure and life. Fugitives
from Slavery, known as the Exiles of Florida, found a
home among these Indian warriors, and the question
arose how they should be treated, being, on a smaller
scale, the very question which now occupies us. Major-General
Gaines insisted, that, when captured, they were
prisoners of war, and, in reply to claimants, he refused
to surrender them, somewhat in the temper of Hotspur,
even to the extent of denying his prisoners.<a name="FNanchor_154_154" id="FNanchor_154_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a> Then followed
Major-General Taylor, afterwards President, who,
in reply to claimants asking him “to turn over certain
negroes,” said, “I cannot for a moment consent to meddle
with this transaction,”<a name="FNanchor_155_155" id="FNanchor_155_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a>&mdash;thus giving example of
just sensibility. At last the Exiles surrendered to Major-General
Jesup as freemen. Afterwards, when their condition
was in question, the General wrote: “By my
Proclamation, and the Convention made with them,
when they separated from the Indians and surrendered,
<em>they are free</em>.” And then again he wrote: “I, as commander
of the army, and in the capacity of representative
of my country, solemnly pledged the national faith
that they should not be separated, nor any of them
sold to white men or others, but be allowed to settle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
and remain in separate villages, <em>under the protection of
the United States</em>.”<a name="FNanchor_156_156" id="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a> Thus apparent, from beginning to
end, are obligations to fugitives from bondage, while by
concurring and consecutive authority that principle is
established under which the camp becomes a refuge
against Slavery.</p>

<p>This conclusion is reinforced by language attributed
to General Gaines, and extensively published in the
newspapers. “The military officer can enter into no
judicial examination of the claim of one man to the
bone and muscle of another as property. Nor could
he as a military officer know what the laws of Florida
were, while engaged in maintaining the Federal Government
by force of arms. In such case he could only be
guided by the Laws of War; and whatever may be the
laws of any State, they must yield to the safety of the
Federal Government.” Nothing can be clearer, stronger,
or more to the point.</p>

<p>Thus have we example in the past as in the present,
and from military quarters, pointing to a rule,
which, though of seeming simplicity, would be of incalculable
efficacy, if honestly and sincerely enforced.
Then would our camps become nurseries of freemen,
and every common soldier a chain-breaker, while Slavery
shrunk out of sight.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>There is a higher agency that may be invoked, which
is at the same time under the Constitution and above
the Constitution: I mean Martial Law in its plenitude,
and declared by solemn Proclamation. It is under the
Constitution, because the War Power to which it belongs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
is positively recognized by the Constitution. It
is above the Constitution, because, when set in motion,
like necessity, it knows no other law. For the time it
is Law and Constitution. The civil power, in mass and
detail, is superseded, and all rights are subordinate to
this military magistracy. Other agencies, small and
great, executive, legislative, and even judicial, are absorbed
in a transcendent triune power, which, for the
time, declares its absolute will, while holding alike the
scales of justice and the sword of the executioner. The
existence of this power nobody questions. If rarely
exercised in our country, and never largely, the power
is none the less fixed in our political system. As well
strike out the kindred law of self-defence, belonging to
states as to individuals. Martial Law is only a form of
self-defence.</p>

<p>That this law might be employed against Slavery,
without impediment from State Rights, was first proclaimed
in the House of Representatives by a Massachusetts
statesman, who was a champion of Freedom,
John Quincy Adams. [<i>Applause.</i>] His authority is
such that I content myself with the sanction of his
name, which becomes more commanding when we consider
the circumstances under which he first put forth
this great rule, then repeated it, and then again most
defiantly vindicated it.</p>

<p>Student of history, and of Public Law in all its forms,
from earliest youth, under the teaching of his father,
counsellor-at-law, Senator of the United States, Minister
at foreign courts, including Holland, Prussia, Russia,
England, negotiator of Peace at Ghent, then Secretary
of State and President, this illustrious citizen, after
such varied experience, entered the House of Representatives,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
where it became his duty to expound the War
Power in our government, especially with regard to
Slavery. On such a question, his whole life was the
open book from which he spoke with magistral authority.
No well-worn, dog-eared volume was needed.
Himself was enough. And the circumstances of the
debate, with the sensitiveness of the hour, gave new
force to the principle which he announced.</p>

<p>A select committee on the Abolition of Slavery reported
a resolution declaring “That Congress possesses
no Constitutional authority to interfere in any way with
the institution of Slavery in any of the States of this
Confederacy.” Before the vote, the Ex-President asked
to be heard, saying, “If the House will allow me five
minutes’ time, I pledge myself to prove that resolution
false and utterly untrue.”<a name="FNanchor_157_157" id="FNanchor_157_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a> Here he was called to order,
and resumed his seat. The resolution was adopted.
Immediately thereafter, on the same day, he obtained
the floor on another subject, being a resolution for the
distribution of rations among unfortunate sufferers in
Alabama and Georgia, and having first remarked that
his reasons for voting against the former resolution,
founded on the power of Congress, would be a justification
for the vote he should give in favor of the proposed
distribution, he proceeded to discuss the War Power
under the Constitution, portraying the various wars
actually menaced, including a civil war, while with
prophetic voice he exclaimed, “Your own Southern and
Southwestern States must be the battle-field upon which
the last great conflict must be fought between Slavery<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
and Emancipation,” and then announced the supreme
power of Congress.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“From the instant that your slaveholding States become
the theatre of war, civil, servile, or foreign, from that instant
the war powers of Congress extend to interference with
the institution of Slavery in every way by which it can be
interfered with,&mdash;from a claim of indemnity for slaves taken
or destroyed, to the cession of the State burdened with
slavery to a foreign power.”<a name="FNanchor_158_158" id="FNanchor_158_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a></p>

</div>

<p>I give but an extract. Again, after other years,
with added experience, we find this exalted citizen asserting
the same War Power, and holding up to terrified
Slave-Masters the prospect of Universal Emancipation.<a name="FNanchor_159_159" id="FNanchor_159_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a></p>

<p>Meanwhile the question was discussed by friend and
foe, being always in the blaze of the public press, when,
on the 14th of April, 1842, our champion returned to it
again, asserting the power of Congress with new vigor
and detail. This was after the introduction of resolutions
by Mr. Giddings, setting forth the relations of
the National Government to Slavery, where it was
declared without reservation that each of the several
States composing this Union has full and <em>exclusive</em> jurisdiction
over the subject of Slavery within its own territory.<a name="FNanchor_160_160" id="FNanchor_160_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a>
The Ex-President, while accepting the other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
resolutions, was unwilling to vote for this complete
surrender to the Slave States, and here again he was
driven to find opportunity for speech on another question.
It was on the Civil and Diplomatic Appropriation
Bill, and the salaries of our foreign ministers,
when, with masterly ability, in a speech of two days,<a name="FNanchor_161_161" id="FNanchor_161_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a>
he reviewed our foreign relations, warning especially
against war with England and Mexico; and then by
natural transition depicted again the power of Congress
in such emergency. These are his words:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“It is a War Power. I say it is a War Power; and when
your country is actually in war, whether it be a war of invasion
or a war of insurrection, Congress has power to carry
on the war, and must carry it on according to the Laws of
War; and by the Laws of War an invaded country has all
its laws and municipal institutions swept by the board, and
Martial Law takes the place of them. This power in Congress
has perhaps never been called into exercise under the
present Constitution of the United States. But when the
Laws of War are in force, what, I ask, is one of those laws?
It is this: that, when a country is invaded, and two hostile
armies are set in martial array, <em>the commanders of both armies
have power to emancipate all the slaves in the invaded territory</em>.”<a name="FNanchor_162_162" id="FNanchor_162_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Still further, he announces, in words precisely applicable
to the present hour:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Nor is this a mere theoretic statement. The history of
South America shows that the doctrine has been carried into
practical execution within the last thirty years. Slavery
was abolished in Colombia, first, by the Spanish General Murillo,
and, secondly, by the American General Bolivar. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
was abolished by virtue of a military command, given at the
head of the army; and its abolition continues to be law to
this day.”<a name="FNanchor_163_163" id="FNanchor_163_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Condensing then the whole subject, and bringing it all
into one final statement, he says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I might furnish a thousand proofs to show that the pretensions
of gentlemen to the sanctity of their municipal institutions,
under a state of actual invasion and of actual war,
whether servile, <em>civil</em>, or foreign, are wholly unfounded, and
that the Laws of War do in all such cases take precedence.
I lay this down as the Law of Nations. I say that the military
authority takes, for the time, the place of all municipal
institutions, <em>and of Slavery among the rest</em>; and that under
that state of things, so far from its being true that the
States where Slavery exists have the exclusive management
of the subject, <em>not only the President of the United States,
but the commander of the army, has power to order the Universal
Emancipation of the slaves</em>.”<a name="FNanchor_164_164" id="FNanchor_164_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a> [<i>Applause.</i>]</p>

</div>

<p>His confidence in this principle was complete. As
he uttered it, he said, addressing the Presiding Officer,
“I have no more doubt of it than that you, Sir,
occupy that chair”; and he called upon Slave-Masters
to answer him, if they could, “not by indignation, not
by passion and fury, but by sound and sober reasoning
from the Laws of Nations and the Laws of War.”
No attempt to answer him was ever made; but the
wrath of Slavery was poured still more unsparingly
upon the head of the venerable orator. Meanwhile
his words have stood as a towering landmark and beacon-flame.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span></p>
<p>In the protracted controversy now drawing to a close
in blood, Massachusetts has done much. She, first of all,
gave the example of Universal Freedom within her borders;
and ever since that early day she has taken the
leading part against Slavery. It is her children who
have never failed in this cause, where anything was to
be done, whether by word or deed. Massachusetts, for
years, has borne the burden of this discussion, and also
the heavier burden of obloquy long resting upon all
who speak for the slave. It is Massachusetts who
with patriotic ardor first leaped to the rescue, when the
capital was menaced by Slavery [<i>applause</i>], and by
happy coincidence, on the 19th of April, consecrated
herself anew by the blood of her people [<i>applause</i>],&mdash;thus
being at the same time first to do and first to
suffer. [<i>Immense applause.</i>] It was also a Massachusetts
General who first in this conflict proclaimed that
our camps cannot contain a slave [<i>vociferous applause</i>];
and it was an illustrious Massachusetts statesman who
first unfolded the beneficent principle by virtue of
which, constitutionally, legally, and without excess of
any kind, the President, or a Commanding General, may
become more than conqueror, even Liberator. [<i>Applause
and great sensation.</i>]</p>

<p>Massachusetts will be false to herself, if she fails at
this moment. [<i>Sensation.</i>] And yet I would not be
misunderstood. Feeling most profoundly that there is
an opportunity now for incalculable good, such as occurs
rarely in human annals, seeing clearly that there is one
spot, like the heel of Achilles, where this great Rebellion
may be wounded to death, I calmly deliver the
whole question to the judgment of those on whom the
responsibility rests, contenting myself with reminding
you that there are times when <em>not to act</em> carries with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
it greater responsibility than <em>to act</em>. It is enough for
us to review the unquestioned powers of Government
to handle for a moment its mighty weapons, yet allowed
to slumber, without assuming to declare that
the hour has come when they shall flash against the
sky.</p>

<p>May a good Providence save our Republic from that
everlasting regret which must ensue, if a great opportunity
is lost by which all the bleeding wounds of
war shall be stanched, and prosperity again assured,
while Peace is made immortal in the embrace of Liberty!
[<i>Applause.</i>] Saul was cursed for not hewing
Agag in pieces when this enemy was in his hands, and
Ahab was cursed for not destroying Benhadad. Let no
such curse ever descend upon us!</p>

<p>Anxious as I am, I cannot doubt the result; but I
long to make it more sure and inevitable. Among
works of art handed down from Antiquity, and regarded
with greatest wonder, is that unrivalled marble, where
Laocoön with his two sons is sculptured in serpent
folds, vainly struggling, and slowly yielding to terrific
death. Poetry also has pictured the scene. Thus does
our country now writhe in the torturing folds of Slavery,
the fearful serpent which came swimming out of
the sea and fastened upon the Republic; but, God be
praised! the Republic shall live, and the serpent be
bruised to death.</p>

<p>“So many enemies as slaves!”<a name="FNanchor_165_165" id="FNanchor_165_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a> Unless this ancient
proverb has ceased to be true, there are now four millions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
of enemies intermingled with the Rebels, toiling in
their fields, digging in their camps, and sitting at their
firesides, constituting four millions of allies to the National
Government. Careful calculation demonstrates,
that, out of this number, more than one million are of
an age for military service,&mdash;that in Virginia alone
there are 121,564 male slaves of this important period,
in Missouri 21,334, and in Kentucky 51,900. Can we
afford to reject this natural alliance, quickened by a
common interest, and consecrated by humanity? I call
the alliance natural. Let history testify; and here I
quote acknowledged authority. In the famous Peloponnesian
War, when Greece suffered as we are suffering
now, and her own people were arrayed under hostile
banners, Greek meeting Greek, slaves often passed over
from one side to the other, carrying sometimes oxen and
sheep, and always practical knowledge of the country,&mdash;on
one occasion twenty thousand in number, mostly
mechanics: all of which is described by the great
historian Thucydides,<a name="FNanchor_166_166" id="FNanchor_166_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a> who records also that the martial
Lacedæmonians, in dread of their Helots, most cruelly
took the lives of two thousand, selected for energy and
character.<a name="FNanchor_167_167" id="FNanchor_167_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a> Thus in other days have slaves played their
part, while slave-masters dwelt in fear. Of this trepidation
there are abundant illustrations, some farcical.
From Aristophanes we learn, that, during the same Peloponnesian
War, the Athenians were unwilling to punish
their slaves, lest they should desert. This dramatist,
in one of his most famous comedies, has a character
who, after exclaiming that “the slaves snore as
never before,” pours forth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span> his maledictions on the
War, because he can no longer apply to them the
wonted castigation.<a name="FNanchor_168_168" id="FNanchor_168_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a> The great philosopher of Greece
accords with the historian and dramatist. Plato does
not hesitate to say that “slaves and masters can never
become friends”;<a name="FNanchor_169_169" id="FNanchor_169_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a> and he tells us how frequent are
servile insurrections, especially in cities where the
slaves speak one language, instancing customary outbreaks
of the Messenians, and crowning his statement
with the declaration, prompted by the universal human
heart, even without experience as a slave, which had
been his own lot, that “a man is a difficult possession
to hold”:<a name="FNanchor_170_170" id="FNanchor_170_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a> and here our Fugitive Slave Bill with
its terrible conditions, and the fugitive slaves of our
country with their tragedies, are in harmony with this
voice from Antiquity.</p>

<p>There is another motive not to be neglected. Without
this alliance insurrection is inevitable, destined to
be wild and lawless. This should be prevented. If
Liberty does not descend from the tranquil heights of
power, it will rise in blood, amidst the confusion of
families. And what difference between the two apparitions!
One has the face of an angel, radiant with
celestial life; the other the front of a demon, “shaking
from its horrid hair pestilence and war.” [<i>Great applause
and cheering.</i>] All this was clearly seen by the
Emperor of Russia, when, on the 21st of September,
1858, he called upon his people to unite with him in
Emancipation, “which,” he nobly declared, “ought to
begin <em>from above</em>, to the end that it may not come <em>from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
below</em>”; and now this very year twenty millions of
Russian serfs are peacefully passing from the house
of bondage. Cheered by this great example, forget
not that <em>it began from above</em>.</p>

<p>There is another practical advantage where the action
proceeds from Government. The interest of loyal
citizens can be protected. Compensation may relieve
the hardships of meritorious classes, or of individual
cases; nor can I object. Never should any question of
money be allowed to interfere with human freedom.
Better an empty treasury than a single slave. A Bridge
of Gold would be cheap, if demanded by the retreating
Fiend.</p>

<p>Two objects are before us, Union and Peace, each for
the sake of the other, and both for the sake of the country;
but without Emancipation how can we expect
either?</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Fellow-citizens, I have spoken frankly; for such is
always my habit. Never was there greater need of
frankness. Let patriots understand each other and
they cannot differ widely. All will unite in whatever
is required by the sovereign exigencies of self-defence;
which means that all will unite in sustaining the National
Government, and driving back the Rebels. But
this cannot be by any half-way measure or lukewarm
policy. There must be no hesitation. Hearken not to
the voice of Slavery, no matter what its tone of persuasion.
It is the gigantic Traitor and Parricide,&mdash;not for
a moment to be trusted. Believe me, its friendship is
more deadly than its enmity. [<i>Sensation.</i>] If you are
wise, prudent, economical, conservative, practical, you
will strike quick and hard,&mdash;strike, too, where the blow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
will be most felt,&mdash;strike at the mainspring of the Rebellion.
Strike in the name of the Union, which only
in this way can be restored,&mdash;in the name of Peace,
which is vain without Union,&mdash;and in the name of
Liberty also, sure to bring both Peace and Union in
her glorious train.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>As Mr. Sumner closed, the hearty approval of the sentiments of the
speech found utterance in the most enthusiastic and long-continued
demonstrations of applause.</p>

<h3>APPENDIX.</h3>

</div>

<div class="medium">

<p>Outbursts of the public press, and other exhibitions of opinion,
showed at least that the speech was felt, even where condemned. Some
were bitter, and expressed their bitterness strongly; others were grateful,
rejoicing that at last their thoughts and desires found utterance.
Its reception at the time was peculiarly part of the speech; so also was
its origin, and the motive which led to it.</p>

<h4>THE PRESIDENT AND MR. SUMNER ON EMANCIPATION.</h4>

<p>From the beginning Mr. Sumner never doubted that rebellion must
cause the end of Slavery. So he spoke and wrote often during the previous
winter. As the Slave States became more perverse, he exclaimed,
“Slavery will go down in blood!” But this would be only in the
event of war, which seemed inevitable. A day or two before the bombardment
of Fort Sumter, when President Lincoln mentioned to him
confidentially the determination to provision and hold this fort, repelling
force by force, Mr. Sumner remarked, “Then the War Power will be
in motion, and with it great consequences.” In the solemnity of that
moment, when peace seemed banished, although saddened inexpressibly,
he saw at once the mighty instrument before which Slavery must
fall, and never for one moment afterwards did he doubt the final result.
He would not and could not believe the success of the Rebels possible;
but he saw no way to success on our part, except through Emancipation.
Therefore he awaited anxiously the moment when this weapon
could be employed. Shrinking from bloodshed, he wished this irresistible
ally to close the war. Vowed against Slavery, he was eager
to see it smitten. And still further, feeling the peril of European
intervention, he longed for a declaration on our part that would make
such an act impossible. In his judgment, our foreign relations depended
much on Emancipation. So that the whole situation at home
and abroad was involved in this question.</p>

<p>At the earliest practicable moment he did not hesitate to press these
considerations upon the President. This was immediately after the
Battle of Bull Run. An earlier incident will explain what passed on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
this occasion.</p>

<p>Some time towards the close of the preceding May, while the National
troops were gathered about the capital, and during an evening drive with
the President alone in his carriage, Mr. Sumner brought up the subject
of Slavery, in order to say that the President was right in his course at
that time, but that he must be ready to strike when the moment came.
On the day of the disaster he was with the President twice, but made
no suggestion then. On the second day thereafter, when the tidings
from all quarters showed that the country was aroused to intense
action, he visited the President expressly to urge Emancipation. The
President received him kindly, and, when Mr. Sumner said that
he had come to make an important recommendation with regard to
the conduct of the war, replied promptly, that he was occupied with
that very question, and had something new upon it. Mr. Sumner,
thinking that he was anticipated, said, “You are going against Slavery!”
“Oh, no, not that!” he replied, impatiently. “I am sorry,”
said Mr. Sumner, when the President, with increasing impatience, reminded
him of the evening drive in his carriage, and then retorted:
“Did you not then approve my course?” “Certainly,” said Mr.
Sumner, “at that time; but I said also that you must be ready to
strike at Slavery, and now the moment has come. Of this I have no
doubt.” And he proceeded to urge his reasons, but could not satisfy
the President. The interview, which was late in the evening, did not
terminate till midnight.</p>

<p>So completely had Mr. Sumner acted on the idea of waiting for a
moment to strike, that in two different bills introduced by him before
the disaster at Bull Run, one, July 16th, entitled, “For the confiscation
of property of persons in rebellion against the Constitution
and Laws of the United States,” and the other, July 18th, entitled,
“For the punishment of conspiracy and kindred offences against the
United States, and for the confiscation of the property of the offenders,”
there is no open mention of Slavery. In the first bill there is a
provision for the forfeiture of “the property, real and personal, of
every kind whatsoever, and wheresoever situated within the limits of
the United States, belonging to any person owing allegiance to the
United States, who shall be found in arms against the United States,
or shall give any aid or comfort to their enemies.” The other bill contains
a clause equally stringent, but general in character. But after
that disaster to our arms, he was satisfied the time had come for a
full exercise of the War Power, and he desired earnestly to have the
President lead the way openly and without reservation.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>

<h4>POLICY OF FORBEARANCE.</h4>

<p>Meanwhile the policy of forbearance was continued, giving, as
Mr. Sumner thought, moral strength to the Rebellion, and postponing
success. By General Orders from Head-Quarters at Washington, July
17th, Slave-Masters obtained new security for their pretended property,
in the following terms.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Fugitive slaves will under no pretext whatever be permitted to reside,
or in any way be harbored, in the quarters and camps of the troops serving
in this department. Neither will such slaves be allowed to accompany
troops on the march. Commanders of troops will be held responsible for
a strict observance of the order.”<a name="FNanchor_171_171" id="FNanchor_171_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a></p>

</div>

<p>In harmony with this military order was an opinion of the Attorney-General,
of July 23d, by which the marshals of Missouri were
reminded that the Fugitive Slave Act must be executed.<a name="FNanchor_172_172" id="FNanchor_172_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a> Then came
the correspondence between General Butler and the War Department.
The former, in a letter from Head-Quarters, Fortress Monroe, July
30th, after speaking of “the able-bodied negro fit to work in the
trenches as property liable to be used in aid of rebellion, <em>and so contraband
of war</em>,” and then with unanswerable force declaring our duty to
fugitive slaves, announced a definite policy as follows.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“In a state of rebellion I would confiscate that which was used to oppose
my arms, and take all that property which constituted the wealth of that
State and furnished the means by which the war is prosecuted, beside being
the cause of the war; and if, in so doing, it should be objected that human
beings were brought to the free enjoyment of life, liberty, and the pursuit
of happiness, such objection might not require much consideration.<a name="FNanchor_173_173" id="FNanchor_173_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a></p>

</div>

<p>To this annunciation Mr. Cameron, Secretary of War, replied, under
date of August 8th:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“It is the desire of the President that all existing rights in all the States
be fully respected and maintained.”</p>

</div>

<p>And then, after forbidding troops to interfere “with the servants of
peaceable citizens in house or field,” it was declared, as if to help the
Fugitive Slave Act:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Nor will you, except in cases where the public good may seem to
require it, prevent the voluntary return of any fugitive to the service from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>which he may have escaped.”<a name="FNanchor_174_174" id="FNanchor_174_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a></p>

</div>

<p>These various declarations were followed, August 16th, by a speech
of Hon. Caleb B. Smith, Secretary of the Interior, at a social festival
in Providence, R. I., which seemed to give point to all. This Cabinet
officer said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The minds of the people of the South have been deceived by the artful
representations of demagogues, who have assured them that the people of
the North were determined to bring the power of this Government to bear
upon them, for the purpose of crushing out this institution of Slavery.…
The Government of the United States has no more right to interfere with the
institution of Slavery in South Carolina than it has to interfere with the
peculiar institution of Rhode Island, whose benefits I have enjoyed.”<a name="FNanchor_175_175" id="FNanchor_175_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Then came the reversal by the President of General Fremont’s
Proclamation in Missouri, where, under date of August 30th, this
officer, commanding the Western Department, announced a system of
partial and local Emancipation as follows.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The property, real and personal, of all persons in the State of Missouri,
who shall take up arms against the United States, or who shall be directly
proven to have taken an active part with their enemies in the field, is declared
to be confiscated to the public use, and their slaves, <em>if any they have,
are hereby declared freemen</em>.”<a name="FNanchor_176_176" id="FNanchor_176_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The enthusiasm with which this provision was received by the country
could not save it from the judgment of the President.</p>

<p>These incidents, still showing in certain quarters a constant tendency
towards Emancipation, checked always by the Executive, attested
a policy of forbearance towards Slavery. Regarding this condition of
things as disastrous and of evil omen for the future, Mr. Sumner earnestly
strove to arrest it. His speech was an appeal to the country.</p>

<h4>CRITICISM AND COMMENT.</h4>

<p>Attacks upon the speech were not prompted exclusively by friendship
to Slavery. Personal opposition to Mr. Sumner, never mitigated
by compromise on his part, found vent, in the hope of influencing his
reëlection as Senator, although this could not occur till the next year.
Such, at least, was the motive of some. Hon. William Claflin, President
of the Senate, wrote as early as February 7, 1861, when the Crittenden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
Compromise was finding support in Massachusetts:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The truth is, there is a desperate effort under the surface to drive you
from the Senate next winter, and, if <em>nothing</em> is done, it is feared by many
that the Conservative force will get so strong as to drive both you and
Andrew from your seats.”</p>

</div>

<p>A correspondent of the <i>Plymouth Memorial</i> put this point strongly.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“It is true, the country press spoke out and denounced this attack upon
Mr. Sumner, and the attempt which is being made to take him from his
place and put in it some weak-backed quietist, who, afraid to look this
thing in the face, would palter weak commonplaces, and, while the patient
writhed in the paroxysms of pain, would administer soothing drops instead
of strong medicine to cure the disease. Mr. Sumner struck at Worcester
the key-note of an anthem that will, ay, that is now being taken up by
the people, and the sound of which will put the croaking of these penny
trumpets far out of hearing.”</p>

</div>

<p>The <i>Norfolk County Journal</i>, by one of its correspondents, explained
the opposition.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Of course no man with his eyes open needs to be told that this furious
onslaught on Mr. Sumner has very little to do with this speech. <em>It is the
opening of the war to defeat his reëlection next fall.</em> A year ago the same
papers made, if possible, more savage attacks upon Mr. Andrew. Before
he was nominated every one of them opposed him, and after his nomination
not one of them supported him cordially; and most of them predicted, that,
though he might be carried through by the Presidential election, yet in another
year the reaction would sweep him into oblivion. They will find
themselves equally mistaken about Mr. Sumner.”</p>

</div>

<p>Wendell Phillips, alluding to the assaults upon the speech, wrote:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“If it had no other advantage, suffice it that it shows you who your personal
enemies are.”</p>

</div>

<p>Not content with arraigning the policy proposed by Mr. Sumner,
his assailants became critics of another sort. They insisted that he
was wrong in his illustrations from history,&mdash;misrepresenting the decree
of Emancipation at Athens, and misquoting Plutarch.</p>

<p>The decree of Emancipation can be read, and also the record of the
excitement which followed. That Hyperides at a desperate moment
proposed Emancipation as a measure of defence against a triumphant
conqueror is indisputable, and that such a measure was already known
in Athens among war powers is attested by the scholiast of Aristophanes,<a name="FNanchor_177_177" id="FNanchor_177_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a>
while a candid interpretation of all the circumstances, including
the acceptable peace unexpectedly offered by Philip, points to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
the conclusion that the latter was unwilling to provoke this untried
warfare.<a name="FNanchor_178_178" id="FNanchor_178_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a> This incident is described by a French writer, who gives
to it the same effect as Mr. Sumner:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Philippe, au bruit de cette proposition, dont l’adoption pouvait ébranler
la Grèce entière, <em>s’arrêta, frappé d’épouvante</em>.”<a name="FNanchor_179_179" id="FNanchor_179_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The heaviest blows were on account of Plutarch, and here it is not
easy to comprehend the anger displayed. Endeavoring to present the
idea of Emancipation in its proper relief, Mr. Sumner brought forward
the proclamation of liberty to the slaves, saying nothing of others
joining Marius, according to the familiar translation of Langhorne,
well satisfied that the slaves were the effective force; and the speech
was so reported in the newspapers. Then came the attack, with
learned newspaper <i>scholia</i>, garnished with Greek type, insisting that
the husbandmen and shepherds, called “freemen” in Langhorne’s
translation, and not the emancipated slaves, were authors of the success
which carried the illustrious adventurer into the Roman Forum, there
to clutch with dying grasp his seventh consulate.</p>

<p>The text of Plutarch is the best answer. That interesting biographer
speaks of the slaves first, <em>putting the Proclamation of Emancipation
foremost</em>; and this is precisely what was needed for the argument.
Nor was Mr. Sumner alone in omitting to mention particularly the
husbandmen and shepherds, whether freemen or freedmen. Good
scholars had done precisely the same. Dr. Liddell, head master of
Westminster School, and one of the authors of the favorite Greek
Lexicon, describing this event, gives prominence to the Proclamation
of Emancipation, without mentioning any freemen, saying: “Like all
the partisan leaders of this period, <em>he offered liberty to slaves</em>, and soon
found himself at the head of a large force.”<a name="FNanchor_180_180" id="FNanchor_180_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a> Smith’s Dictionary
of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology says that Marius
“landed at Telamo in Etruria, and, <em>proclaiming freedom to the slaves</em>,
began to collect a large force.”<a name="FNanchor_181_181" id="FNanchor_181_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a> And the great historian Niebuhr,
after referring to his landing on the coast of Etruria, where he was
joined by Etruscan cohorts, adds,&mdash;“Marius was not at all delicate in
collecting troops, and even <em>restored slaves to freedom on condition of
their taking up arms for him</em>.”<a name="FNanchor_182_182" id="FNanchor_182_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a> Thus both these authorities, in harmony<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
with Dr. Liddell, treat the Proclamation as the chief feature,
precisely as Mr. Sumner presented it, and all three leave out of view
the “freemen.”</p>

<p>Admitting that there were “freemen,” their part was evidently secondary,
unless in reality they were the new-made “freedmen,” as a
scholar has suggested. The predominance of the latter is conspicuous in
the old English translation by Sir Thomas North:<a name="FNanchor_183_183" id="FNanchor_183_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a> “<em>And being landed,
proclaimed by sound of trumpet liberty to all slaves and bondmen that
would come to him.</em> So the laborers, herdmen, and neat-herds of all that
marsh, for the only name and reputation of Marius, ran to the seaside
from all parts.” It appears also in the historic fact, that, when Marius
landed in Etruria, there were few or no husbandmen and shepherds already
free. They were slaves. According to Plutarch, the first prompting
of Tiberius Gracchus to his career as a reformer was observation
in this very region. Passing through Etruria, on the way to Spain, he
was troubled to find “scarce any husbandmen or shepherds except slaves
from foreign and barbarous nations.”<a name="FNanchor_184_184" id="FNanchor_184_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a> Niebuhr, following Plutarch,
says that “he saw far and wide no free laborers, but numbers of slaves
in chains.”<a name="FNanchor_185_185" id="FNanchor_185_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a> The language is strong,&mdash;“far and wide no free laborers.”
This was 137 years B. C. Somewhat later, 45 years B. C., Julius
Cæsar by positive law required that of herdmen one third should always
be free,<a name="FNanchor_186_186" id="FNanchor_186_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a> thus showing that two thirds at least were then slaves.
It is only reasonable to suppose, that, if slaves were everywhere at the
earlier date, and so numerous at the later date, it would have been
impossible at the landing of Marius, 87 years B. C., to form an army
of freemen in a few days. Only fourteen years later the gladiator
Spartacus called the slaves to his standard, and they came by tens of
thousands, so as to stifle the local power; and here again is testimony
to their comparative numbers.</p>

<p>Nothing is clearer than the diminution of the free population of
Italy at this period. An excellent authority speaks of it as “the most
notorious evil of the times”;<a name="FNanchor_187_187" id="FNanchor_187_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a> and this is attested by others. It
is easy to infer that the freemen must have been few by the side
of the slaves. Naturally, therefore, did the experienced general make
his appeal to this most numerous and sympathetic class: he knew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
that so his strength would be best assured. And this was the very
position of Mr. Sumner. It is evident that Plutarch himself was
of the same opinion; for shortly afterwards, in narrating these events,
he records that the other side did not suffer so much through incapacity
“as by anxious and unseasonable attention to the laws,”<a name="FNanchor_188_188" id="FNanchor_188_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a>
in preventing Emancipation. This important testimony is most vividly
stated in the old translation of North, when he describes the
opponent of Marius in Rome as failing “not so much for lack
of reasonable skill of wars <em>as through his unprofitable curiosity and
strictness in observing the law</em>; for, when divers did persuade him
to set the bondmen at liberty to take arms for defence of the Commonwealth,
he answered, that he would never give bondmen the law
and privilege of a Roman citizen, having driven Caius Marius out of
Rome to maintain the authority of the law.”<a name="FNanchor_189_189" id="FNanchor_189_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a> Here was passion for
consistency, and want of practical sense. Marius was not troubled
in this way.</p>

<p>Another circumstance makes the conclusion yet clearer. On entering
Rome, Marius surrounded himself, according to Plutarch, “with
a guard <em>selected</em> from the slaves that had repaired to his standard,”<a name="FNanchor_190_190" id="FNanchor_190_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a>
or, according to the same authority in another place, “the slaves,
whom he had admitted his fellow-soldiers,“<a name="FNanchor_191_191" id="FNanchor_191_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a> thus attesting still further
their superior importance. In the troubles that ensued these
freedmen played a bloody part, until they were destroyed by Sertorius;
and here again their numbers appear. According to Plutarch,
the guard ”<em>selected</em> from the slaves that had repaired to his standard”
was four thousand,<a name="FNanchor_192_192" id="FNanchor_192_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a> or not far from the ordinary complement of a Roman
legion, which the accomplished scholar, Mr. George Long, tells
us was the very force collected by Marius in Etruria.<a name="FNanchor_193_193" id="FNanchor_193_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a> Plainly, therefore,
the emancipated slaves constituted the main body, if not the
whole legion.</p>

<p>Whatever may be the text of Plutarch, and supposing freemen among
the recruits, nothing can prevent the conclusion, that emancipated
slaves constituted the decisive force by which success was achieved.
Therefore this example illustrates the efficacy of a proclamation giving
freedom to slaves, and for this purpose it was adduced.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span></p>
<p>This discussion seems a diversion now; but at the time of the speech
the criticism was a reality,<a name="FNanchor_194_194" id="FNanchor_194_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a> attracting attention and helping to arrest
the great cause. To cap the climax, it was gravely argued, that, even
if the Proclamation had the effect attributed to it, we must not imitate
Caius Marius,&mdash;for he was no better than a barbarian.</p>

<h4>THE PRESS.</h4>

<p>Specimens from the press show the condition of the public mind at
the time, and the controversy which arose, extending to foreign countries.
If there were enemies, so also were there friends, both at home
and abroad.</p>

<p>The <i>Boston Daily Advertiser</i> thus frankly denounced the speech.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“We are sorry to see a disposition in several quarters to represent the Republican
party, mainly on the strength of Mr. Sumner’s unfortunate speech
at Worcester, as a party of Emancipation, a ‘John Brown party,’ a party
that desires to carry on this war as a war of Abolition.… The Convention
certainly disavowed any intention of indorsing the fatal doctrines announced
by Mr. Sumner, with a distinctness which can scarcely be flattering to that
gentleman’s conception of his own influence in Massachusetts.… It is
alleged that the Convention cheered Mr. Sumner. His supporters among
the delegates and spectators undoubtedly did so: but who does not see that
this goes for nothing, in the face of the obvious fact that the silent party
who disapproved were so much superior in number as to control the action
of the whole body?… We hold it for an incontestable truth, that neither
men nor money will be forthcoming for this war, if once the people are impressed
with the belief that the Abolition of Slavery, and not the defence of
the Union, is its object, or that its original purpose is converted into a cloak
for some new design of seizing this opportunity for the destruction of the
social system of the South.… The speech to which we have several times
referred has certainly done as much as lay within the compass of one man’s
powers to inspire this suspicion, to distract and weaken the loyal, and by
indirection to aid the disloyal.”</p>

</div>

<p>The <i>Boston Evening Gazette</i> was in harmony with the <i>Advertiser</i>.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“His appearance this year was not in accordance with the wishes of those
who do not follow his lead, but regard him as one of the most irrepressible
impracticables of the party.… The sentiments uttered by Mr. Sumner are
opposed to the spirit of the times, to the policy of the Administration, and
are detrimental to the prosperity of the cause. They are Charles Sumner’s
ideas; he is responsible for them; and the Convention, by killing the resolutions
offered by Rev. James Freeman Clarke, of Boston, which substantially
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>indorsed the speech of Mr. Sumner, repudiated the Emancipation sentiments
which Mr. Sumner attempted to induce the Republicans to adopt as a
part of their policy. It was a most lamentable failure, and should prove
a lesson to men who are so entangled in one idea that they imagine the
wealth of the country and the blood of its sons are being poured out to perpetuate
a party, instead of securing the safety of the Union and the Constitution.</p>

<p>“After reading Mr. Sumner’s speech, one can but regret that a mind possessed
of such culture should give utterance to sentiments that will stimulate
the flames which now threaten the destruction of the ship of state, and provoke
discord among the noble men who are striving to save it. Had some
unknown individual spoken the same words at this time, we doubt not many
would have regarded him as a fit inmate for an insane asylum; but it is the
position and antecedents of the Senator which alone shield him from the
suspicion of being a proper person against whom a writ <i>De lunatico inquirendo</i>
might be issued.… The tone of the speech and the manner in which
it was delivered are the acme of arrogance.”</p>

</div>

<p>The <i>Boston Journal</i> did not differ much from the <i>Advertiser</i>, except
in manner.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Mr. Sumner and other radical Antislavery men, dazzled by visions of
Universal Freedom, entirely overlook the insurmountable difficulties which
stand in the way of immediate emancipation. The unutterable horrors of
a servile insurrection do not present themselves, or they would shrink from
the prospect. The economic problem of supporting four millions of human
beings who have never been self-dependent is not considered. All practical
considerations, in fact, are ignored by a miscalled philanthropy which is as
impracticable as it is visionary, and which would lay waste the most prolific
soil, and fill our land with vagrants and marauders.</p>

<p>“We must limit the war to the purposes so distinctly avowed by the Administration,
or the sun of our national prosperity will set in darkness and
gloom, to rise again, if at all, only after years of bloodshed and anarchy.
Proclaim the policy of Emancipation, and all hope of a reconstruction of the
Union will be crushed out. All the loyal elements in Maryland, Kentucky,
and Missouri will be alienated at once, and every prospect of awakening the
dormant loyalty in the seceded States will have passed away. It will come
to this, that we must subjugate or be subjugated. The people of the South
would defend their homes and their firesides to the last extremity, as we
would do, should the chances of war favor them. The present generation
would not see the end of such a contest, unless the North should be conquered
and subdued by the aid of foreign bayonets or internal dissensions.
From such a war we may well pray to be delivered.”</p>

</div>

<p>The <i>Norfolk County Journal</i> declared dissent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“We are not prepared to indorse the doctrines to which Mr. Sumner gave
utterance in his Worcester speech. They strike us as not pertinent to the
present stage of the Rebellion. Though their application may become a
necessity in the future, public sentiment is as yet unready to adopt and enforce
them. They were especially infelicitous in being advanced at a Convention
to which men of varying views of public policy had been invited,
and their influence has not conduced to that harmony of political action in
Massachusetts which it is desirable to bring about.”</p>

</div>

<p>The <i>Springfield Republican</i>, among many things, said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“We fear it is but an illustration of the mental perversity produced by
entire absorption in a single aspect of a great question, without regard to its
manifold relations, and by the ‘sacred animosity,’ which, too exclusively
nourished, renders the best men reckless of means in the pursuit of what
they consider the chief end of life.”</p>

</div>

<p>On the contrary, the able Boston correspondent of that paper wrote:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Charles Sumner’s speech was the great event of the day, however. It
was an epoch and a victory in itself. The right thing was said, in the right
way, at the right time, by the right man. It was wise, conservative, practical,
as Mr. Sumner always is, and it unquestionably met the views of four
fifths of the audience. Those who did not enthusiastically applaud said,
‘Oh, it isn’t quite time; Sumner is right; this will be the <em>result</em>, we hope
and expect; but let us wait for Providence and the Administration.’”</p>

</div>

<p>The <i>Boston Post</i>, representing the Democracy, declared itself.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Mr. Sumner’s speech at Worcester yesterday was in direct opposition to
the policy of the Administration, the declaration of Congress, and the avowed
purpose of the war,&mdash;overflowing with the same narrow, bitter, and unconstitutional
sentiments that have done so much to bring our present misfortunes
upon us, and which tend to render the restoration of the Union
impossible. If such views as he advances governed the action of the Administration,
<em>not a brigade could be kept in the field</em>, or money enough raised
by the Secretary of the Treasury to buy breeches and gaiters for a demagogue
Senator. For such men as Sumner and his ilk do not fight nor pay;
they only brawl, and deserve to be treated as were old scolds in days past,&mdash;<em>ducked
in a horse-pond</em>.”</p>

</div>

<p>Then in another article:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The error of having listened to this speech cannot be repaired. The
Republicans can set the matter right, as to this being indorsed by the friends
of the Administration in Massachusetts; and it would seem to be incumbent
on the Republican State Committee to make a statement of facts, going to
show, that, as a body, it did not invite Mr. Sumner to speak,&mdash;that, though
the noisy Abolitionists shouted, yet the main body of the Convention evidently
and notoriously heard him with sorrow.”</p>

</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span></p>
<p>And again, by a correspondent, the same Democratic organ said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Can any patriot read the rodomontade of this classic fanatic at the
Worcester Convention, without a sense of pain, nausea, and disgust? He
certainly ought to be put in a strait-jacket.”</p>

</div>

<p>The <i>Boston Courier</i> promptly said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The sincerity of the Republican managers, in appealing to Union men of
all parties to meet with them in Convention, is not certainly placed beyond
question by the fact that Mr. Sumner (not without invitation, we apprehend)
comes forward as the organ of the assembly, and makes the principal speech
of the occasion, as he did at the Convention last year. At that period this
was felt as at least an awkward circumstance, considering the unquestionable
Antislavery ultraisms of Mr. Sumner. Of all men in the community,
this, and this alone, was the special vocation of this Senator,&mdash;to denounce
a domestic usage of a part of the country, which, whether good or bad, is
protected by its Constitution and laws.”</p>

</div>

<p>In another issue the same paper characterized the speech as one,
“the insane counsels of which considerate men of all parties regard
with such dislike and indignation.”</p>

<p>The <i>Newburyport Herald</i> said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Charles Sumner’s speech will be found on our first page to-day. We
give it not by way of approval, for it seems to us the worst speech that
could be made. Its only influence will be to distract and divide the North,
and raise up a faction here against the Administration, which has declared
for an entirely different policy,&mdash;while at the South it will kill what little
Union sentiment remains, and rejoice the Rebel hosts, giving them better
ammunition for their treason than powder would be.… We don’t know
how it appears to others, but it seems to us, that, if Jeff Davis had liberty to
send his own agent here to do the worst for us, he could have done nothing
more. The war can be fought upon no such grounds; and before it closes,
we shall discover that fact.”</p>

</div>

<p>The New York <i>Journal of Commerce</i> was quite sententious.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The Republicans of Boston desire to be rid of any connection with the
fanatic Senator’s remarks. The signs of the times improve.”</p>

</div>

<p>The <i>Carbon Democrat</i>, of Pennsylvania, breaks forth in condemnation.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“If there were any lack of evidence to prove that Charles Sumner is
really an enemy to our country, and desired only to destroy it, and immerse
the people in the dreadful, crashing slavery of martial tyranny, this speech
supplies the link, and makes the train of evidence against his fealty strong
as Holy Writ. He here unblushingly proclaims the horrid policy of unloosing
the bonds of four million slaves, and setting them against the Caucasian
race,&mdash;to murder, pillage, and destroy, without stint, until their barbarous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>appetites may be appeased.…</p>

<p>“In this connection we might suggest that Marius was a very proper
example for Senator Sumner and his school of politicians to quote. Like
them, he was the very prince of office-seekers.…</p>

<p>“He advocates a doctrine which is in direct violation of the spirit of the
Constitution, and which tends only to weaken the hands of the Government,
by dividing public sentiment at the North, and thus discouraging enlistments.
Why is it that the Government, thus assailed, does not lay its hand
upon this fulminator of treason, and secure him safely behind the bars and
bolts of Fort Lafayette?”</p>

</div>

<p>The <i>New York Herald</i> thus interpreted the speech:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Now we beg leave to submit, that this speech, from this Senator, at this
crisis, comprehends an Abolition warning to the Administration, and a warning
to the States involved in this Rebellion. Mr. Sumner is supported in his
views by an active Abolition faction, extending from Massachusetts to Missouri,
and with this faction an exterminating crusade against Slavery is the
all-absorbing idea. Let the President and his Cabinet, then, exert their energies
to the uttermost for a speedy blow or two which will break the backbone
of this Rebellion, or we know not what may be the consequences to the
Administration from the fanatical hostility of this Abolition faction to the
conservative policy of Mr. Lincoln. On the other hand, we would appeal to
the Union men of the Border Slave States to turn out at once, and en masse,
to the active support of the Government, and thus restore the Union in its
integrity, including the integrity of Southern institutions, in the speedy expulsion
of the Rebels into the Cotton States. With the Border Slave States
rescued, this whole Rebellion will soon fall to pieces from its own weight;
but every day that the Rebels continue to menace Washington, to desolate
Missouri, and to hold a threatening lodgement in Kentucky, the danger to
Southern Slavery is increased, and of a protracted and desolating war of
sections, factions, and races.”</p>

</div>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Against these voices were others very different in tone.</p>

<p>The <i>National Antislavery Standard</i> of New York, in an elaborate
leader, united with Mr. Sumner.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“We lay before our readers to-day the admirable speech of Mr. Sumner
before the Republican Convention at Worcester, Massachusetts. We shall
not invite their attention to it, for we are sure they cannot keep their attention
away from it, and it will well repay all that they have to bestow. It is a
bold, clear, and conclusive exposition of the policy which the United States
Government should adopt, and make the vital principle of their action, in
the present war. Mr. Sumner is the first public man of eminent station
who has dared to indicate the true and only way of escape for this nation
out of its dangers; and whether his counsel be hearkened unto or mocked,
he will go into history as the first man of high political rank who has discerned
and not shrunk from proclaiming this saving truth.”</p>

</div>

<p>The New York <i>Independent</i> published the speech promptly upon its
delivery, with the remark:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The following masterly and patriotic speech was made by Hon. Charles
Sumner at the recent Republican Convention in Massachusetts which renominated
Governor Andrew.”</p>

<p>The same paper, in another issue, followed the speech with a tribute
which has merit of its own.</p>

<p>The <i>New York Tribune</i> said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The Hon. Charles Sumner yesterday delivered an eloquent speech at
the Republican Convention at Worcester, Mass., which we print this morning.
He confined himself almost exclusively to a consideration of the subject
of Slavery in its relation to the war; he took the ground that the
overthrow of Slavery will at once make an end of the war, and justified that
policy by many historic examples.”</p>

</div>

<p>The <i>Tribune</i> also published a dramatic sketch between a Conservative
and a Reporter, exposing the reports about the reception of the
speech. Here are a few lines.</p>

</div>

<p>The Boston <i>Liberator</i> spoke of it as “this dispassionate and statesmanlike
speech”; but a correspondent complained of Mr. Sumner’s
confidence in the Administration, saying:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“No, we are not yet saved! And it is the Commander-in-Chief of the
Army, and the elected head of the nation, it is Abraham Lincoln himself,
who obstructs, by the exercise of his individual will, the nation’s entrance
upon that movement against Slavery which Mr. Sumner has shown to be
the direct course, and the only course, to success against the Rebellion.”</p>

</div>

<p>By another of its correspondents the same paper said:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“If I had a fortune, however large, I would exhaust the last cent in the
way I have chosen, and in getting up petitions from the Free States, especially
from Massachusetts, which should meet Congress at the very threshold
of the session nearly upon us, and which should inspire Senator Sumner to
submit his Plan of Emancipation to that body at once, and give foundation
and impulse for an immediate and triumphant vote in his favor.”</p>

</div>

<p>The <i>Boston Traveller</i> announced the following:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Several thousand copies of Senator Sumner’s recent speech at Worcester,
which disturbed the equanimity of some of our contemporaries, have
been circulated in Kentucky. A Colonel of that State, now in the Union
service, writes thus: ‘Sumner’s speech strikes the key-note for the Union
cause in Kentucky, and his policy, if followed up by the Administration,
will insure us a speedy triumph.’”</p>

</div>

<p>The country press of Massachusetts espoused the speech warmly.</p>

<p>The New Bedford <i>Evening Standard</i>, always ready against Slavery,
declared its sympathy, while giving testimony to the reception of the
speech by the Convention.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“We have no apology to make to our readers for inserting the noble
speech of Mr. Sumner at the Worcester Convention. Its perusal by all
earnest and sincere lovers of Freedom will no doubt be a rich treat, as it was
to those who had the pleasure of hearing it from the Senator’s lips. <em>The
manner in which it was received by nine tenths of the Convention was a true
indication of the state of feeling in the Old Bay State.</em> We have been
pained, as well as surprised, to see the manner in which some Republican
papers, as well as individual members of the party, have spoken in condemnation
of this speech.”</p>

</div>

<p>The <i>People’s Press</i>, of Fall River, said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The <i>Boston Journal</i> may call it ‘ill-timed eloquence,’ but we believe
that the people are rapidly coming to the conclusion that the Honorable Senator
has resolutely spoken the needed truth, and has indicated the proper course
for our Government to pursue, in order to put down rebellion most speedily
and effectually, and secure a permanent peace and an undivided country.”</p>

</div>

<p>The <i>Taunton Gazette</i> said:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“This suggestive speech of the eloquent Senator is not in a strain which
is just now popular. He does not sigh for the things which have passed
away, but calmly fronts the demands of the future; and what he sees and
declares of swift-coming events is in keeping with the sternest struggles for
Liberty, and in full accordance with the irrepressible instinct which animates
our armed free laborers, however the trimming politicians may denounce
their declaration. Let us not speak ill of this forecast and courage.
None knew better than he, that, for the time being, he was rendering a
thankless service. Indeed, we venture to say that no other man holding
high office in the government, or desiring to hold, will dare to second or in
any way publicly approve of the vital suggestions of this address.”</p>

</div>

<p>The <i>Dedham Gazette</i> was positive for the speech, and also as to its
favorable reception.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The most significant feature of the Convention was the speech of Mr.
Sumner, which was received with the strongest expressions of approval by
the great mass of delegates present. The fixed and earnest attention with
which every word was received, and the hearty and repeated applause
which greeted every allusion to the doctrine of Emancipation, proved conclusively
that upon this question the people are far in advance of the Government.”</p>

</div>

<p>The <i>Charlestown Advertiser</i> testified to the reception of the speech at
the Convention.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“This speech by the Hon. Charles Sumner has been assailed during the
last fortnight by a herd of political scribblers, none of whom, however, have
the wit to refute its positions. The Republican Convention sanctioned it, on
its delivery, with the most hearty applause.”</p>

</div>

<p>The Haverhill <i>Publisher</i> expressed itself with caution.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“As was said, in remarking upon the Worcester Convention, Mr. Sumner
furnished the sensation matter for the occasion, so it now appears; for all
over the country the press is lively with comment upon it, and in every
circle it is the theme of discussion. It may be well to remember that the
speech of Mr. Sumner will test the spirit of his constituents, and time will
show whether they will sustain this great statesman, not as a partisan, but as
a moral and philosophical force, in the evidently Heaven-appointed mission of
keeping the public eye fixed upon a great principle, regardless of politicians
or parties.”</p>

</div>

<p>The <i>Northampton Free Press</i> said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Charles Sumner was present at the Convention, and made one of his best
speeches on Slavery and its relation to the war. It is sound in argument,
and such a one as might be expected from its author. It was received with
great applause; but the <i>Springfield Republican</i> calls it ill-advised and out of
place.”</p>

</div>

<p>The <i>True American</i>, of Erie, Pennsylvania, said:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The speech from Hon. Charles Sumner, made at Worcester, Massachusetts,
on the 1st inst., and which is printed in full upon our first page, deserves
the attention of every reader. It is a calm and statesmanlike argument
in favor of suppressing this guilty Rebellion by removing its guilty
cause. It is a clear vindication of a necessary policy. Coming from a man
in his high official position, it is significant. And we believe, with a contemporary,
that he will not have to wait for the verdict of posterity to justify
and exalt the great truth his speech embodies. Indeed, we are confident
that his word will find a response in all that is best of the North,&mdash;and not
only in all that is best in quality, but strongest in numbers.”</p>

</div>

<p>The Philadelphia <i>Public Ledger</i> held the scales:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Although Mr. Sumner, and Massachusetts at his back, are disposed to
move faster than the rest of the North upon the Slavery Question, there is
no doubt that whatever amount of injury, consistent with the Laws of War,
inflicted on the South, will bring this Rebellion most speedily to an end
will find the next Congress prepared at least to consider it. Mr. Sumner
has proved very conclusively, that, as a punishment to Rebels and bad citizens,
the manumission of the slaves is fully recognized by those old Roman
laws which the South-Carolinians have been so fond of quoting in their own
behalf. But Mr. Sumner has not proved, we think, that it would be policy
to adopt at once and irrevocably so extreme a measure as to set at liberty
some four millions of slaves.”</p>

</div>

<p><i>Le Messager Franco-Américain</i>, a French journal at New York, thus
balanced the account:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Mr. Charles Sumner, the eloquent Senator of Massachusetts, is indefatigable
in his devotion to the cause of Free Labor. Always in the breach
with the ardor of a true patriot and of a friend of Liberty, he contends without
cessation for the triumph of those great principles of Right and Justice
consecrated by the National Constitution.… Mr. Sumner is a light of
the Antislavery army. He sees the cause of right and of country in danger.
As a vigilant sentinel, he gives the signal of alarm. Let the civil war continue,
and the cry of Emancipation by Mr. Sumner will find powerful
echoes in the Northern States. The conservative and honest population at
the South should reflect upon this.”</p>

</div>

<p>Crossing the ocean, the same differences appear, with allusions to
the character of the war. Here was evident disposition to recognize
in Mr. Sumner exceptional earnestness against Slavery, while
the country was worse than indifferent. This view was presented by
no less a person than the Earl of Shaftesbury, in a speech at a public
meeting, reported in the London <i>Times</i>, July 25, 1861, where he
said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“There had, however, been no great feeling in the country for either one
or the other of the parties; for the country did not believe in the sincerity
of either. The North had conceded everything to Slavery that it could
possibly demand; so the South had certainly no cause for rebellion. But in
the struggle they were entering on, the North never thought of putting an
end to Slavery; for, <em>if such a declaration had been made, they would have had
the sympathy of every man in England</em>: he was almost afraid to say how far
he thought that sympathy would have gone.… There was no honest
feeling on the subject of Slavery in America, except among the Abolitionists
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>headed by that great and good man, Charles Sumner.”</p>

</div>

<p>Similar expressions of good-will to Mr. Sumner had appeared in
France. Besides allusions in the writings of M. Laboulaye and M.
Cochin, there was a contemporary notice in a letter from Washington,
of August 12, 1861, in the <i>Opinion Nationale</i> of Paris, evidently by a
gentleman who accompanied Prince Napoleon on his summer tour in
the United States.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I have been present at sessions of the Senate and House of Representatives.
I have had pointed out to me the most influential members of both
parties, … Mr. Sumner, Massachusetts Senator, acknowledged leader
of the Abolitionists, an amiable, educated man, having travelled much in
France, the friend of De Tocqueville, and very well versed in our literature.”<a name="FNanchor_195_195" id="FNanchor_195_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a></p>

</div>

<p>In harmony with this testimony was the sketch by Colonel Ferri-Pisani,
aide-de-camp of Prince Napoleon, in his letter from Washington
of August 10, 1861.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The person with whom the Prince has formed the most sympathetic
relations is Mr. Sumner, Senator of the State of Massachusetts (Boston), and
declared partisan of the Abolition of Slavery. Mr. Sumner is one of the
most eloquent men of the United States, a mind highly instructed, very
cultivated, especially versed in French literature, which he studied in
France. He was the friend of De Tocqueville, and is personally connected
with a great number of our writers and thinkers. His manners are as distinguished
as his intelligence. He inspires among the partisans of the
South a furious hate; in return, he passes for the warmest partisan of the
French alliance, and for the friend of our Legation.”<a name="FNanchor_196_196" id="FNanchor_196_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a></p>

</div>

<p>These testimonies prepare the way for expressions which found utterance
abroad after the speech at Worcester, and help explain the notice
it received.</p>

<p>The London <i>Times</i>, always against the Union in its efforts to put
down the Rebellion, said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“While statesmen, merchants, and bankers are laboring to carry on a
suicidal war in a conservative spirit, and to spare the interests and prejudices
of the foe, a more numerous class from the Atlantic to the Mississippi have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>no such scruple, and go to the root of the evil. Slavery, they are told by
one of the most eloquent of the agitators, himself a martyr in the cause,
is the original sin of the Union, the cause of every subsequent dissension,
the occasion of this war, and, what is more, the strength of the wrong
cause, and the weakness of the right. Mr. Sumner refers to Slavery every
misery, every mishap, every difficulty of the Federal cause,&mdash;and tells
listening thousands that all they do, the sacrifices they make, their taxation,
their life-blood, their commercial interests, everything they have,
suffer, do, or hope, is all flung into that Maelström, never to reappear.
The whole American nation, with all its wealth and all its glory, is flung
as a holocaust before the shrine of this hideous idol. The remedy he
proclaims is to give up the weak scruple which paralyzes a righteous
arm. Mr. Sumner sees in this war not merely a call to rally round a
Constitution, to punish treason, and reinstate a mighty power; he sees
a call to a higher level of humanity, and a sublimer doctrine. “Not
Union, but Freedom,”<a name="FNanchor_197_197" id="FNanchor_197_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a> is his cry. This is the fated weapon for the decision
of the contest. This alone can defeat the foe, whose strength is in
Slavery.…</p>

<p>“Now all this we have heard before. It is a story in Mr. Sumner’s
mouth, and according to him it is as old as the Declaration of Independence
itself, and the first struggles of the Commonwealth. What, we have
to ask, is its fresh significance at the present hour? According to Mr. Sumner,
its significance is most critical. Slavery he makes out to be the very
balance on which the fortunes of America now hang.…</p>

<p>“Every nation in the world has had to give up its pretensions at one
time or another; and the Federal Government will only follow the example
of the most powerful sovereigns and the wisest ministers, if it makes peace
in time, before it is committed to a treble war,&mdash;with the Confederates,
the British, and its own Abolitionists at home.”</p>

</div>

<p>The London <i>Herald of Peace</i>, in its opposition to the war, took pains
to insist that it was not Antislavery,&mdash;forgetting that the North, even
when failing to demand the abolition of Slavery, sought its limitation,
and that the new Government openly declared Slavery its corner-stone.
After setting forth Mr. Sumner’s “proposal to use the War Power to
proclaim at once, as respects the Rebels, the emancipation of their
slaves,” and that “the speech was received with many demonstrations
of applause,” it dwells on the circumstances favoring the effort: that
it was in Massachusetts, of all the States “the most forward in the
Antislavery cause”; that “the subject was presented by one whose
judgment they were most bound to honor, and whose lead they were
most likely to follow,” whom it describes.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Mr. Sumner is a man of whom Massachusetts might well be proud.
His great abilities, his lofty spirit, his spotless public life, mark him as a
man standing apart, not to be confounded with the crowd of selfish politicians
that besiege the avenues of power in America. He has stood forward
in evil days to encounter with an undaunted mien the obloquy and
the peril attaching to the avowal of thorough Antislavery principles, and
has been not the champion merely, but the martyr of the cause.”</p>

</div>

<p>After this presentation, it goes on to ask, “Well, and what was the
reception which Mr. Sumner’s proposal met from the Republican Convention
of the State of Massachusetts?” It finds an answer in the
refusal to act on the resolutions of Mr. Clarke, and then says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“After all this, we sincerely hope we shall hear no more of this war as a
war for the liberation of the slave, as a ‘sublime uprising’ of the men of
the North for the cause of Human Freedom.”</p>

</div>

<p>The London <i>Post</i>, which did not sympathize with the National
cause, said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“If the Federal Government are in want of an <i>ex parte</i> defender, they
will certainly find one in Mr. Charles Sumner. When he tells the Republican
State Convention at Worcester, that Rebellion never assumed
such a front since Satan made war upon the Almighty, he used first the
hyperbolical language which the most abject courtier of an absolute monarch
in the Middle Ages could have suggested in condemnation of some
insurrection that had broken out in one of his provinces.… <em>Mr. Sumner
narrows the question now dividing the North and South distinctly into a war
of Slavery.</em> Hence he appeals to European sympathies in behalf of the
North. Now this view is in great part true, yet it is not wholly true.…
It is not simply in respect of Slavery, as Mr. Sumner represents it, that the
South differs from the North. The leading men of the South were commonly
of different extraction from the leading men of the North. That
difference has developed a broad distinction in social habits, in political
ideas, in consent to authority, and in other characteristics which constitute
the idiosyncrasy of a nation.… We cannot, therefore, agree with Mr.
Sumner, that the question is essentially and wholly a slave question, any
more than we can regard the secession as a rebellion against quasi-Divine
authority.”</p>

</div>

<p>But the National cause was not without defenders abroad, nor the
speech without sympathy.</p>

<p>The London <i>Daily News</i>, in an elaborate leader, with an abstract of
the speech, said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The most remarkable circumstance which we have yet chronicled is
the speech of Mr. Charles Sumner in defence of the war.… We regard
Mr. Sumner’s speech as most important in every point of view. It is the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>best answer which has been yet made on American ground to those who
complain that hitherto the cause of the North has not met with the sympathy
it deserved in Britain. But passing this, it shows to the Northerners
themselves what it is that paralyzes their arms, what it is that places them
so generally on the defensive and prevents their success. Let Mr. Sumner’s
policy be adopted, and it would not only strike terror into the hearts of the
Rebels, but would animate the masses of volunteers in the North with a
‘spirit which would render them still more formidable.’”</p>

</div>

<p>A London commercial paper, <i>The Floating Cargoes Evening List</i>, published
a considerable extract, with a line from the speech as its caption,
“Look at the war as you will, and you always see Slavery,” and
the following notice:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The present American war exercises so powerful an influence upon
commercial affairs in general, that the expression of an opinion on this
subject by one of the most eminent American statesmen deserves special
notice.”</p>

</div>

<p>The London <i>Morning Star</i> thus declared its sympathy:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The speech delivered by the Hon. Charles Sumner, at the Republican
Convention at Worcester, in Massachusetts, is one of the most significant
events of the American crisis.… In vigorous and eloquent words Mr.
Sumner has told the plain truths which we have frequently reiterated,
and there was not heard even the whisper of a dissentient voice.<a name="FNanchor_198_198" id="FNanchor_198_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a> He
pointed out that Slavery is the great enemy to the preservation of the
Union, and that its eradication would bring the war at once to a close.…
Emancipation must come, and its calm concession by an act of executive
power can alone prevent its ultimate consummation by red-handed
insurrection. The enthusiastic assent which was evoked by Mr. Sumner’s
noble words&mdash;words worthy alike of the man and of his theme&mdash;is a
cheering foretaste of the triumph which cannot be long deferred.”</p>

</div>

<p>In the English island of Jersey, one of the Channel Isles, on the
coast of France, the <i>Independent and Daily Telegraph</i> published the
speech at length, with an article entitled “The Orator of Freedom,”
where it said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“As a general rule, even those who like to listen to good speeches do not
care to read long speeches, good or bad. But even such persons need not
our recommendation to give their attention to the graceful periods and
electrifying appeals of, probably, the most accomplished of American speakers,&mdash;perhaps
we might justly say the foremost orator speaking the Anglo-Saxon
tongue; for, rivalling Gladstone in genius, he more than rivals the
glory of England’s House of Commons by that holy earnestness which imparts
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>to eloquence its chief effect, and which naturally is the product of
circumstances rather than of individual will.… The principles of the
Massachusetts Senator command our thorough adhesion, as his extraordinary
talents challenge our admiration, and his courageous consistency carries
with it our respect. But, although we can make every allowance for President
Lincoln and his ministers, and those Massachusetts men who hesitate
to invoke the sword of Spartacus, still, we repeat, all our sympathies are
with Mr. Sumner, and the cause of which he is the champion, and the
policy of which he is the exponent.… Although grammarians will not
allow the comparative and superlative of ‘right,’ and know nothing of
‘righter’ and ‘rightest,’ we must nevertheless affirm that General Butler
was right, General Fremont more right, and that Senator Sumner is most
right.”</p>

</div>

<p>Crossing to the Continent, the controversy continues.</p>

<p>The <i>Précurseur</i> of Antwerp, in Belgium, said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Mr. Charles Sumner has pronounced very energetically in favor of the
Abolition of Slavery, and demanded, with great strength of expression and
power of argument, the introduction of this question into the conflict. He
demanded especially, that the Executive Power should pronounce in favor
of Immediate Abolition by a declaration, perfectly legal according to him,
that all slaves coming within the lines of the Federal [National] army
should be free. This declaration seems to him at the same time constitutional
and justified by precedents. The Executive Power has this right in
virtue of Martial Law. The most significant fact, and which augurs the definitive
solution of the question, is, that the speech was received with great
enthusiasm by the audience; and since it presents in effect the most rapid
solution of a burdensome war, it becomes now more than probable that the
pressure of public opinion will not be slow in making itself felt by the
Federal Government.”</p>

</div>

<p>The <i>Pays</i>, at Paris, an Imperialist journal, said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“It appears that in the State of Massachusetts public views are divided
as to the means to be employed for joining the pieces of the American
Union. The most violent, represented by Senator Sumner, preach war to
the knife, and the emancipation of the blacks. They propose to give liberty
to all the slaves in the Union, with indemnities to loyalists only. Thus,
then, if we are to believe Senator Sumner, the surest way of establishing
peace in North America will be to let loose several millions of blacks, and
incite them to murder and incendiarism.”</p>

</div>

<p>On the other hand, in France was the testimony of Count Agénor
de Gasparin, noble friend of the national cause, who, in a powerful
work, cited the speech at Worcester, and adopted its conclusion,<a name="FNanchor_199_199" id="FNanchor_199_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a>&mdash;also
of M. Édouard Laboulaye, who, at a later day, when presiding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>
over the Antislavery Conference at Paris, surrounded by the Abolitionists
of all countries, paid a flattering tribute to Mr. Sumner,
winding up with allusion to this speech:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Charles Sumner, a man who in his turn took up this cause and defended
it with the most admirable eloquence, which, as you probably all
know, was the occasion of his being nearly killed in his place in the Senate,&mdash;an
act for which the assassin was rewarded by his Southern friends. They
gave him a cane, gold-mounted, bearing the inscription, ‘<i>Hit him again.</i>’
Mr. Sumner came to France, and we made his acquaintance at that time.
The object of his journey was the reëstablishment of his health,&mdash;and he
recovered it; for he it was, who, during the whole of the war, was the real
adviser of America: he felt, and he said, more boldly than any one, that the
war could be terminated only by the Abolition of Slavery.”<a name="FNanchor_200_200" id="FNanchor_200_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The position accorded to Mr. Sumner in Europe, beginning especially
with this speech, was attested at a still later day in an article by
M. Michel Chevalier, a Senator of France under the Empire, renowned
for various writings, especially in Political Economy. In a sympathetic
review of the address on the “Duel between France and Germany,”
this authority thus expresses himself:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The opinion embodied in the writing which I am about to analyze, and
which is a mixture of sympathetic words and of severe counsels for
France, is not that of one or many assemblies, of one or many popular
meetings, of one group or of many groups of journals; it is that of one
man. But this man is one of the most distinguished citizens of his country;
he has exercised a supreme influence in the events of which the great
Republic has been the theatre since the moment when, in 1861, the South
declared that it broke the Union, and at the mouth of the cannon seized
Fort Sumter, situated in the harbor of Charleston. Mr. Charles Sumner
has not figured on the battle-field; he was elsewhere, in the Senate of the
United States, from which place, it can be said, he was the political director
of the conflict.… But the thought of extirpating Slavery, of obliging the
Slave States to modify their internal system so as to render impossible the
reëstablishment of servitude under another name, the idea of assimilating
by law the black and mulatto with the white,&mdash;assimilation to which until
then their habits were as repugnant as their laws,&mdash;these have belonged
to Mr. Charles Sumner more than to any other person, and were the basis
of a plan which has triumphed by the indomitable will and the ever-ready
eloquence of this statesman. It can therefore be said of Mr. Charles Sumner,
that he is in himself a public opinion.”<a name="FNanchor_201_201" id="FNanchor_201_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a></p>

<h4>CORRESPONDENCE.</h4>

<p>As after the speech on the Barbarism of Slavery, so now, letters came
with volunteer testimony. Beyond their interest as tokens of strong
and wide-spread sympathy with Mr. Sumner, they have historic value
as illustrations of the intense Antislavery sentiment destined so soon to
triumph. Sometimes they are directly responsive to the press, especially
in the severity of its criticism on the speech. Here, as before,
Abolitionists took the lead.</p>

<p>Wendell Phillips thus earnestly placed himself by the side of his
friend:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I both thank and congratulate you most heartily on your great speech,
for some reasons the <em>boldest</em> even you ever made,&mdash;the first statesmanlike
word worthy of the hour from any one in a high civil position,&mdash;fit response
from Statesmanship to War,&mdash;showing the people the reasons and purpose
of Fremont’s proclamation, and giving it more breadth and a nobler basis.</p>

<p>“All agree it was a most decided success,&mdash;taking the Convention
wholly off its feet with enthusiasm; and we absent ones may measure the
strength of the blow from the rebound,&mdash;witness <i>Post</i>, <i>Courier</i>, <i>Journal</i>, and,
basest of all, <i>Advertiser</i>, of course.…</p>

<p>“Never fear but that the masses, the hearts, are all with you,&mdash;and you’ll
see your enemies at your footstool, as you so often have already.”</p>

</div>

<p>And in another letter:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I could not take the hazard of advising you to make it, though I told
you in your circumstances I should; but now you’ve done it, I can say
it was <em>wise</em> and <em>well</em>,&mdash;your duty to the country, to the hour, yourself, the
slave,&mdash;to your fame as a statesman, and your duty as leader.”</p>

</div>

<p>Lewis Tappan, the Abolitionist, wrote from New York:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“‘Union and Peace,&mdash;how they shall be restored.’ You have shown
the way, and the only way. We may have peace on other terms, but no
union <em>and</em> peace. The Free States must choose between peace, temporary
peace, renewed war, and peace founded upon righteousness, justice, and
equity.”</p>

</div>

<p>Hon. Amasa Walker, the able writer on Political Economy, afterwards
Representative in Congress, wrote from North Brookfield:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“You never made a nobler, braver, or more opportune utterance than at
Worcester on the first instant. But all Hunkerdom is down upon you for it,
as I expected. No matter,&mdash;the people, I trust in God, will sustain you. Your
words meet a most hearty response in the hearts of all true men, you may
rest assured. If your positions are not sustained by the country, the great
contest now going on will end in failure, and ought to end so.”</p>

</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span></p>
<p>David Lee Child, the sincere and lifelong Abolitionist, once a journalist
and lawyer, and always a writer, wrote for himself and his wife
from Wayland, Massachusetts:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I was, and my wife was, refreshed and strengthened by your voice from
Worcester. When you gave us the ‘Barbarism of Slavery,’ the grandest,
the most comprehensive, complete, compact, and conclusive of all your
noble utterances against ‘the sum of all villanies,’ I did not write, though
never before so much moved to do so. We read it the night that it reached
us, and were so exalted by it that we sat up two hours beyond our time,
talking about it and rejoicing over it. The foes of justice and freedom accuse
you of accelerating the crisis and precipitating civil war by that
speech. I think they are right for once. The revived victim of frustrate
assassins, the calm and undaunted bearing, the inflexible purpose, the
overwhelming force of facts, argument, and illustration, struck more terror
to the soul of Richard than could the substance of ten thousand soldiers
armed in proof.</p>

<p>“I fully intended to address you as soon as the overflow of my heart became
somewhat proportionate to the capacity of the pen, and to repeat that
quotation from Tully which Junius aptly uses, though less aptly than it applied
then: ‘Quod si quis existimat me aut voluntate esse mutata, aut debilitata
virtute, aut <em>animo</em> fracto, vehementer errat.’<a name="FNanchor_202_202" id="FNanchor_202_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a> But my dear wife
wrote you our joint offering of admiration and gratitude better than I could
do it for myself.”</p>

</div>

<p>Hon. S. E. Sewall, the able lawyer and devoted Abolitionist,
whose sympathy with Mr. Sumner had been constant, wrote from
Boston:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“As I have not time to call on you just now, I cannot forbear writing,
merely to say how delighted I am with your speech at Worcester. I see it
has roused a good deal of howling among our wretched editors. But this
does not convince me that your position is wrong, or that it will not be sustained
by the country. Almost every one whom I see thinks as I do about
your speech, and regards it as eloquent, statesmanlike, and timely. I trust
Congress will think as you do, and act accordingly.”</p>

</div>

<p>George Livermore, who so often wrote to Mr. Sumner with entire
sympathy, and soon afterwards contributed an invaluable service to the
African race,<a name="FNanchor_203_203" id="FNanchor_203_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a> expressed his present anxiety.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I did hope that in this terrible day of our country’s trial there would
be found sufficient patriotism with those sent to Worcester to cast aside
<em>all party</em> considerations and all disturbing differences, and unite, <em>before
it is too late</em>, in trying to save the Government and the Union.… I trembled
when I heard that you had been invited to speak, and I wept when I
read your speech.</p>

<p>“Unless there is a united North, united on the basis of the Constitution
as it is, we are doomed to defeat.”</p>

</div>

<p>Hon. Joshua R. Giddings, at the time Consul General at Montreal,
wrote from that city:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Thanks for your speech at Worcester. I want you to place the same
question before the Senate.”</p>

</div>

<p>Hon. Carl Schurz, at the time Envoy Extraordinary and Minister
Plenipotentiary in Spain, wrote from Madrid:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“First let me thank you for the glorious speech you have delivered before
the Massachusetts Convention. I agree with you on every point, and
expect shortly to fight by your side.”</p>

</div>

<p>William S. Thayer, a writer of admirable sense, and Consul General
at Alexandria in Egypt, wrote:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Well, after all, your Cassandra-like prophecies as to the course of public
affairs have come true to the letter. Time will show whether your declaration
at the Massachusetts Convention, that without Emancipation our
war will be a vain masquerade of battles, will not also be realized. At this
distance from home I do not feel qualified to dogmatize; but we do not appear
as yet to have struck our opponents in a vital part.”</p>

</div>

<p>Hon. Montgomery Blair, Postmaster General, wrote from Washington:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Your speech is noble, beautiful, classical, sensible. I would have timed
it differently; but I will take it now, rather than lose it.”</p>

</div>

<p>Hon. Hiram Barney, Collector of New York, wrote:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I was gratified with it. You indicate the proper course for the Government
to take in this war with Slavery. It is the real Rebel, and Providence
has brought us at length into direct conflict with it. We can destroy it
without violating any right. Now is our opportunity, and I pray God we
may have the wisdom and the intrepidity to end the war humanely and
economically by the speedy destruction of the enemy, Slavery. Peace by
Emancipation is accomplishing a good end by good means. How easily
will the President make his administration the most eventful and glorious
in American history!”</p>

</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span></p>
<p>Hon. Thomas Dawes Eliot, Representative in Congress, pure in life,
and always against Slavery, wrote from New Bedford:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“If the party who have the responsible conduct of our war do not avail
themselves of the power which the Law of Nations gives to them, whereby
to strengthen themselves and defeat the Rebels, we shall find the party
opposed to them will advocate Emancipation as a party issue. And when
the time comes, as it must, that the South shall realize their own inevitable
defeat, and shall see the alternative of submission or Emancipation, they
will themselves initiate Freedom and secure Europe, unless before them we
shall have acted.”</p>

</div>

<p>Hon. E. G. Spaulding, the eminent Representative in Congress, and
a leading member of the Committee of Ways and Means, wrote from
Buffalo:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Our people are earnestly discussing the subject of Immediate Emancipation,
and I desire to see the views of one who has so thoroughly considered
this question. Nearly all our people have come to the conclusion, that,
whenever it is necessary to crush out the Rebellion to abolish Slavery, then
the Government must abolish it.”</p>

</div>

<p>Hon. Robert C. Pitman, afterwards of the Superior Court of Massachusetts,
wrote from New Bedford:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Permit me to thank you cordially for the service rendered by you to our
cause, on Tuesday, at Worcester. Ideas must reinforce our arms, or we
shall neither deserve nor win a victory.”</p>

</div>

<p>Epes Sargent, journalist, another and early friend, wrote from Boston:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I do not think you can be more than two months in advance of the public
sentiment of the North, in your speech. I read it with great satisfaction,
and it was not till I got down town among the politicians that I realized
what imprudent things you had been saying.”</p>

</div>

<p>Hon. Daniel W. Alvord, who had coöperated with Mr. Sumner before,
wrote from Greenfield, Massachusetts:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I thank you for the right word uttered at the right time in your Worcester
speech. I should not deem it necessary to say this, as you could hardly
fail to know that such a speech would meet my hearty approbation, but for
the attacks made upon you by the <i>Springfield Republican</i>. Be assured
that the <i>Republican</i> by no means reflects the feelings or the opinions of the
people of the western counties. The thorough, hearty Republicans, who in
the northwest, if not in the southwest, constitute a great majority, cordially
indorse the reasoning and positions of the speech.”</p>

</div>

<p>Hon. John D. Baldwin, journalist, afterwards Representative in Congress,
and author of the work entitled “Pre-Historic Nations,” wrote<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>
from Worcester:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“What a wave of Hunkerism has flooded Massachusetts since the State
Convention, reaching up to the ceiling of nearly every editorial sanctum!
But the ebb-tide must come.”</p>

</div>

<p>Hon. James H. Morton, the magistrate, wrote from Springfield,
Massachusetts:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I cannot refrain from expressing the satisfaction and pleasure I derived
from the perusal of your Worcester speech. In my opinion it expressed the
sentiment of a very large majority of the citizens of Massachusetts, and
though in advance of the sentiment of the whole country, still, if I can read
the signs of the times, our Government, if it has not already reached, is fast
approaching, the doctrines there enunciated by you. It seems to me they
must be adopted in their length and breadth.”</p>

</div>

<p>A writer, admired as “Gail Hamilton,” wrote from Hamilton, Massachusetts:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I glory in that speech. It is logic, and sagacity, and morality. Let them
maul it. To that complexion must they come at last, and perhaps before.
Strange that people will have so much faith in shilly-shally! Strange they
will not see that honesty is the best policy, as well as the best religion! But
never mind. Do you lead the van.”</p>

<p>Rev. John Weiss, the eloquent preacher, and biographer of Theodore
Parker, wrote from Milton:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I am surprised and disappointed at the temper shown by the Republicans.
Before the Worcester Convention I was ready to declare that the
people were only waiting to have the word Emancipation strongly pronounced
to repeat it with the aggrandizement of a hundred thousand votes.
I am deeply pained to see how the newspapers receive your declarations.
They thinly veil a spirit which is ready at the first opportunity to forget the
Past, and to sacrifice its living representatives,&mdash;the men who alone preserve
the glorious Antislavery idea, and whose prophecies can alone secure
the Future.… ‘Cry aloud, and spare not.’ Reiterate more flatly and
unsparingly, that the war must destroy the evil which engendered it. Give
the bullets their billet, and the bayonets something to think about, and lend
them a manifesto of Freedom to punctuate. What a Congress will next
winter’s be! Compromise will seek to make War its missionary.”</p>

<p>“I have re-read your speech at Worcester, and I’m even better pleased
with it than I was at the first reading. You have struck the right chord,
as the manner in which my own article has been received sufficiently indicates.
Our venerable President and his rhetorical adviser, whatever their
timidity, or their reluctance, or attachment to the ‘Rule of Three,’ must
come to the policy you recommend. It is clear to me that it is impossible
to save both the integrity of the Nation and Southern Slavery, and the great
question before us now is, whether we shall sacrifice the Nation to Slavery,
or Slavery to the Nation. This is the issue before the people, and this issue
we must meet.”</p>

<p>Rev. R. S. Storrs, the eminent Congregational divine, wrote from
Braintree, Massachusetts:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Your admirable speech before the Worcester Convention ought to have
been sooner acknowledged, with the fervent gratitude of my heart, to
Heaven and you, for its delivery. The spirit that condemns its argument
or author is either the spirit of blind infatuation, or of treachery as
foul as marks the Southern Confederates themselves. It surprises and
grieves me that <em>Republicans</em> wince and scold at the <em>just</em> lashing given to
the grand conspirator against Liberty and Religion,&mdash;for in this contest they
are identical. The timeserving policy of multitudes who have hitherto
acted with us, and, as it seems to me, of the Administration itself, is revolting,
and puts far away the day of peace and prosperity.”</p>

<p>Rev. Francis LeBaron, afterwards of Ohio, earnest against Slavery,
wrote from Dighton, Massachusetts:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Let me take this opportunity to thank you most heartily for your Worcester
speech, and for your Boston lecture. Such noble words dwarf other
men’s actions, and make me glad that the feeling of hero-worship is still
strong at my heart. I can see honor and victory and glory and permanence
on no other path than that by which you would lead the nation. If
you will touch men’s hearts so nobly, you must not be surprised that they
leap toward you; and when men move my deepest respect and admiration,
I must tell them so.”</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Accept a ‘thousand thanks’ for your speech at Worcester. It was a

<p>Rev. Elnathan Davis, the friend of Peace, wrote from Fitchburg:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“That the position taken in your speech is true I believe the judgment
of Massachusetts and the country bears full testimony to-day; and that it
is taken in due season I think the very <em>howl</em> of a Hunker political press
clearly testifies. God give you strength for <em>this</em> battle, and, amidst the
shifting experiences of the Government, and above ‘the confused noise
of the warrior,’ make your word ‘<em>On to Freedom</em>’ clearly and widely
heard by our countrymen.”</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“If I bore you, pardon me,&mdash;but, sympathizing most heartily in your
uncompromising hostility to Slavery, and yet placed by the laws in an embarrassing,
if not helpless position, what can I do, in the way of preventing
the rendition of fugitives? For instance, one was hidden in our regimental
barn. I knew and encouraged it, intending to trot him off, if a favorable
chance offered. The owner came, but could not accomplish anything. He
came next day with a United States warrant and the Provost Marshal. It
wrung my heart, but what could I do?… Meantime let me thank you,
as a servant of God and in the name of my brother man, for your Worcester
speech, which I have just read, for your magnificent broadside called the
‘Barbarism of Slavery,’ and for all your efforts to break every yoke and let
the oppressed go free.”</p>

Convention, and I am renewedly glad that you made it then and there. I
am sure that every passing day will but strengthen its positions, and that
they must soon be accepted by the whole Northern people. Indeed, I believe
that the people are of that mind now; it is the politicians, and those
most timid of all created things, the Republican partisan leaders, who
shiver at the thought of raising a <em>real</em> issue to displace their shams.…
Happily, no great principle like this rests on the turn of a period or the
position of a comma; and if Boston scribblers could show that Marius did
not know a slave from a barrel of salt-fish, they would not weaken the
argument of your speech.”</p>

<p>“Cheered and encouraged by your noble speech at Worcester yesterday,

Emancipation in this city, warned by the action of the President in regard

to put down Rebellion without wiping out its cause, we have come

thought of the unrivalled fame that would succeed the act. Has he not
thought of immortality? Or does he wait for Congress to take away the
glory from him, or an accident to take away the opportunity?”</p>

<p>“I have just been reading your speech which was made to the Massachusetts
Republicans, at their State Convention, on the first instant; and the
policy therein so fully declared, which, in your opinion, it is the duty of the
National Government to pursue, agrees so completely with my own views
of our country’s difficulties, and her only way of permanent and successful
escape, that I could not refrain from expressing to you my gratitude, as a
citizen of the good old Commonwealth, that she has one son, at least, who,
regardless of all personal misrepresentations from political enemies or professed
friends, has the moral courage to stand up, upon all occasions and
under all circumstances, and proclaim what he sincerely believes to be the
true and just policy for the Government to adopt.”</p>

</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span></p>
<p>A. B. Johnson, of the Treasury Department, wrote from Washington:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I thank you from my heart for that noble speech at Worcester. That
trumpet gave forth no uncertain sound. Hints have come up from the
West, and intimations, vague, undetermined, from the East, before; but it
has been left for you to define, announce, and defend a logical policy, and
you have accomplished your task.”</p>

</div>

<p>H. Catlin, editor of the <i>True American</i>, wrote from Erie, Pennsylvania:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“How lamentable that we should make Human Slavery the one sacred
thing under the heavens! Everything else must give way,&mdash;every other
property may be confiscated, every other right suspended,&mdash;but <em>Slavery</em>
cannot be touched! Our Proslavery education is costing a great deal,&mdash;it
threatens to cost us our country! Thanks that Senator Sumner so fully
appreciates the real issue of the hour, and that, <em>though a Senator</em>, he proclaims
it manfully and boldly! The masses of the people are with you.”</p>

</div>

<p>A. T. Goodman wrote from Cleveland:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Your speech of October 1st is before me, and I have read and read it
through and through again, no less than three times. There is something
about your speeches that has endeared your name to me, and something in
their tone and in their teachings that tells me they are right in their meaning,
and right in every point, and are very true.”</p>

</div>

<p>Thus, from correspondence, as also from the press, it appears that
Mr. Sumner was not alone. Others were glowing in the same cause,
and their number increased daily. But the great salvation was postponed.
Almost a full year was allowed to elapse before the Proclamation
of Emancipation. And what a year, whether for those in the
tented field and Rebel prisons, or those others waiting, longing, struggling
for Union and Peace through Liberty! Nobody could espouse
such a cause, and feel that its triumph was essential to save the country
from prolonged bloodshed, without effort and anxiety corresponding
in some measure to the transcendent interests involved.</p>

<p>From this time forward Mr. Sumner never missed an opportunity
of urging Emancipation, whether in addresses before the people and
in the Senate, or in direct personal appeal to the President. In the
last he was constant, rarely seeing the President without in some way
presenting the all-absorbing question. These volumes will show the
continuity of his public efforts.</p>

list of Vice-Presidents and Secretaries was unanimously adopted.</p>

<p>Mr. Noyes, upon taking the chair, delivered the following address.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Ladies and Gentlemen</span>:&mdash;Thanking you, as I do, gratefully, for the
kindness which has called me to preside over this meeting, let me remind
you that within the modest chapel which impresses with devotional emotions
every visitor to Mount Auburn, that most beautiful of American
cemeteries, stands a marble statue of one of the patriot leaders of the
American Revolution. Its simple dignity arrests attention and commands
admiration and respect. Stern resolve and unflinching courage are depicted
in lineament and attitude. We see him voluntarily renouncing a high professional
office under the crown to take his place in the forum as a private
citizen, to oppose, without reward, the odious violations of the liberties of
the people by means of Writs of Assistance. His exordium startles the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>prejudiced judges:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“‘Let the consequences be what they will, I am determined to proceed.
The only principles of public conduct that are worthy of a gentleman or a
man are to sacrifice estate, ease, health, and applause, and even life, to the
sacred calls of country. These principles, in private life, make the good
citizen,&mdash;in public life, the patriot and the hero.’</p>

</div>

<p>“Then, rising with the progress of his great theme, he continues:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“‘Every man in a state of Nature is an independent sovereign, subject to
no law but the law written upon his heart and revealed to him by his
Maker. His right to his life, his liberty, and his property no created being
can rightfully contest; these rights are inherent and inalienable.’</p>

</div>

<p>“We watch the effect of his indignant words. They convince and awe,
and yet the royal tribunal dare not decide. It prevaricates and postpones;
but the victory is won, the odious measure is abandoned forever, and the
orator’s utterances have lighted up a flame which Independence alone can
ever quench.</p>

<p>“We go with him from this first theatre of triumph, through many long
years of toil and anxiety in shaping the measures which led to the great
conflict with the mother country, to the General Court guided by his skill
and political sagacity, to the popular assembly alike aroused to turbulence
and hushed to repose by his burning eloquence. We see him hurling defiance
at the minions of power who with secret malevolence assailed his
reputation. We witness their malignant hatred, and their deadly assault
upon his person, when alone and unarmed. We see him fall, covered with
wounds, and carried bleeding to his home.</p>

<p>“Thenceforward, to the actual opening of the Revolutionary drama, and
during its progress, this act of regal barbarism obscured, but did not wholly
extinguish, the light of the great intellect which it sought to destroy; but
all that remained was a wreck, reminding only of the glories of the past.
The crime against the person added to its atrocity a greater crime against
the soul, dooming it to pursue its earthly career in sadness and gloom.
Conscious of being only a monument of decay, well might the gradually expiring
patriot wish, that, when God, in his righteous Providence, should call
him from time into eternity, it might be by a flash of lightning. We may
rejoice that his prayer was answered, and that, too noble to be permitted
to die a common death, in a manner equally affecting and sublime, <span class="smcap">James
Otis</span> [<i>applause</i>] was removed to the mansions of eternal felicity.</p>

<p>“It is the necessary result of barbarism, in all its phases, to furnish historic
parallels by reproducing itself in viler forms. Not a century elapsed,
and a similar atrocity is enacted in the Senate Chamber of the United
States. The ruffians were actuated by as deadly a hate, their malice was
as foul and murderous, their defiance of law was as manifest, their victim
was also the friend and advocate of universal freedom, and as much distinguished
and feared, and he also fell beneath the blows of assassins in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>heart and conduct.</p>

<p>“But here the parallel ends. This outrage did not impair the intellect
which it sought to destroy; that survived the trial, enlarged, strengthened,
purified, to set forward in a new and more glorious career in the cause of
Freedom and Humanity. Instead of the lightning’s flash to remove it to
heaven, a divine influence, equal in potency, has emanated thence, inspiring
it with a larger love of freedom, more zeal in the cause of the oppressed,
and a more earnest conviction that human slavery produces only evil, and
that it should be forever eradicated. [<i>Enthusiastic applause.</i>]</p>

<p>“Happy, then, for us, and for our country, has been the suffering of these
martyrs in the cause of Freedom. The name of James Otis has descended
to posterity on the brightest pages of our history, associated with those of
Hancock, and Adams, and Jay, and Jefferson, and Henry, and Rutledge,
and there it will remain forever.</p>

<p>“The name of that other martyr in the cause of Truth and Justice will
find equal distinction, in future ages, on the roll of philanthropists, with
those of Howard and Clarkson and Wilberforce, and others of that glorious
company, ‘of whom the world was not worthy.’</p>

<p>“But history has also its retributions. The infamous actors in these
tragedies passed away under the scorn and contempt of mankind, their
names only searched for and remembered among the persecutors and slayers
of their race. They who countenanced and approved the last, by a
fitting gradation, became the betrayers and assassins of their country, and
two of these, the highest in station and basest in conduct, are now
awaiting the punishment due to their crimes in a prison within the shadow
of Bunker Hill Monument, [<i>applause</i>,] which indignantly frowns upon them
from base to summit.</p>

<p>“In the reality of the present behold the promise of the future, when all
traitors like them shall meet a similar doom. Still devoting himself to the
cause of his country and to the freedom of the oppressed, the advocate and
friend of all, of whatever rank or condition or color, the scholar, the philanthropist,
the martyr, the statesman has come again among us, and it
is with equal pride and pleasure that I present to you the Hon. Charles
Sumner, not of Massachusetts, but of the United States of America, one
and indivisible.”</p>

</div>

<p>Mr. Sumner then came forward, and was received by the vast audience
with tumultuous applause, in which the ladies joined with
every manifestation of delight. The cheers, and waving of hats and
handkerchiefs, lasted several minutes.</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">MR. PRESIDENT,&mdash;It is my nature to be more
touched by the kindness of friends than by the
malignity of enemies; and I know something of both.
You make me feel that I am among friends. Beyond
this satisfaction, I have additional pleasure in being
welcomed by the Republican Union: first, as you represent
the young men, who are the hope and strength of
the country; and, secondly, as you constitute an association
which has rendered already signal service in
saving the country from the rule of the Slave Oligarchy.
I know well how you brought forward and
supported Abraham Lincoln for the Presidency, and
how you adopted and circulated that masterly speech,
made in this very hall, which completed those titles to
regard that caused his nomination at Chicago and his
triumph with the people.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Fellow-Citizens of New York</span>:</p>

<p>In the presence of such an auditory, so genial and
almost festive in character,&mdash;assembled for no purpose
of party, or even of politics, in the ordinary sense of the
term,&mdash;I incline naturally to some topic of literature,
history, science, or art,&mdash;to something, at least, which
accords with peace. But at this moment, when our whole
continent is beginning to shake with the tread of mustering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>
armies, the voice refuses any such theme. The
ancient poet, longing to sing of Achilles and the house
of Atreus, found that he could sing of love only; and
he snatched from his lyre its bloody string. Alas! for
me the case is all changed. I can speak to you of war
only; but be assured, that, if I speak of war, it is because,
unhappily, war has become to us the only way
of peace.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The Present is apt to appear trivial and unimportant,
while the Past and the Future are grand. Rarely do
men know the full significance of the period in which
they live, and we are inclined to sigh for something
better in the way of opportunity,&mdash;such as was given
to the hero of the Past, or as imagination allots to the
better hero of the Future. But there is no occasion for
this repining now. There is nothing in the Past, and it
is difficult to imagine anything in the Future, more inspiring
than our Present. Even with the curtain yet
slightly lifted, it is easy to see that events are gathering,
which, in their development, must constitute the
third great epoch in the history of this Western Hemisphere,&mdash;the
first being its discovery by Christopher
Columbus, and the second the American Revolution.
It remains to be seen if this epoch of ours may not surpass
in grandeur either of its two predecessors, so that
the fame of the Discoverer and the fame of the Liberator,
of Columbus and of Washington, shall be eclipsed by
the mild effulgence beaming from an act of godlike
justice, creating within its immediate influence a new
heaven and a new earth, and extending to other lands a
life-giving example, so long as men struggle for rights
denied, so long as any human being wears a chain.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>
And this sublime act will be the present substitute for
armies. The ancient Spartan, being asked, “Which is
the greater virtue, justice or valor?” answered in memorable
words, “Where justice is, there can be no need
of valor.”</p>

<p>War is always an epoch. Unhappily, history counts
by wars. Of these, some are wars of ideas,&mdash;like that
between Catholics and Huguenots in France, between
Catholics and Protestants in Germany, between the
arbitrary crown of Charles the First and the Puritanism
of Oliver Cromwell, and like that between our
fathers and the mother country, when the Declaration
of Independence was put in issue. Some originate in
questions of form, some in the contentions of families,
some in the fickleness of princes, and some in the
machinations of politicians. England waged war on
Holland, and one of the reasons openly assigned was
an offensive picture in the Town-Hall of Amsterdam.
France hurled armies across the Rhine, carrying fire
and slaughter into the Palatinate, and involving great
nations in most bloody conflict,&mdash;and all this wickedness
is traced to the intrigue of a minister, to divert
the attention of his sovereign. But we are now in
the midst of a war which, whatever the reasons assigned
by the unhappy men who began it, or by those
who sympathize with them elsewhere, has an origin
and mainspring so clear and definite as to be beyond
question. Ideas are sometimes good and sometimes
bad; and there may be a war for evil as well as for
good. Such was that earliest rebellion waged by fallen
spirits against the Almighty Throne; and such is that
now waged by fallen slave-masters of our Republic
against the National Government. I adopt the language<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>
of Milton, in his masterly prose, when I call it
“a war fit for Cain to be the leader of,&mdash;an abhorred,
a cursed, a fraternal war.”<a name="FNanchor_205_205" id="FNanchor_205_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a> Nor can any courage in
Rebels give true honor. If victorious, they will be
only Satanic saints of Slavery, with place in a most
hateful hagiology.</p>

<p>If you will kindly listen, I shall endeavor to unmask
this Rebellion in its Origin and Mainspring. Only
when these are known can you determine how it is
to be treated. Your efforts will be governed by the
character of the adverse force,&mdash;whether regarded as
motive power or as disease. A steam-engine is stopped
at once by stopping the steam. A ghastly cancer,
which has grappled the very fibres of the human frame,
and shot its poison through every vein, will not yield
to lip-salve or rosewater.</p>

<p>On the sixth of November last, the people of the United
States, acting in pursuance of the Constitution and
laws, chose Abraham Lincoln President. Of course this
choice was in every particular perfectly constitutional
and legal. As such, it was entitled to the respect and
acquiescence of every good citizen. It is vain to say
that the candidate represented opinions obnoxious to
a considerable section of the country, or that he was
chosen by votes confined to a special section. It is
enough that he was duly chosen. You cannot set aside
or deny such an election, without assailing not only
the whole framework of the Constitution, but also the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>
primal principle of American institutions. You become
a traitor at once to the existing government and
to the very idea of popular rule. You snatch a principle
from the red book of despotism, and openly substitute
the cartridge-box for the ballot-box.</p>

<p>And yet scarcely had this intelligence flashed across
the country before the mutterings of sedition and treason
began to reach us from an opposite quarter. The
Union was menaced; and here the first distinct voice
came from South Carolina. A Senator from that State,
one of the largest slaveholders of the country, and a
most strenuous partisan of Slavery, [Mr. <span class="smcap">Hammond</span>,]
openly declared, in language not easily forgotten, that
before the 18th of December South Carolina would be
“out of the Union, high and dry and forever.” These
words heralded the outbreak. With the pertinacity of
demons its leaders pushed forward. Their avowed object
was the dismemberment of the Republic, by detaching
State after State, in order to found a Slaveholding
Confederacy. And here the clearest utterance came
from a late Representative of Georgia [Mr. <span class="smcap">Stephens</span>],
now Vice-President of the Rebel States, who did not
hesitate to proclaim that “the foundations of the new
government are laid upon the great truth, that Slavery,
subordination to the superior race, is the negro’s natural
and moral condition,”&mdash;that “it is the first government
in the history of the world based upon this great
physical, philosophical, and moral truth,”&mdash;and that “the
stone which was rejected by the first builders is in the
new edifice become <em>the chief stone of the corner</em>.”<a name="FNanchor_206_206" id="FNanchor_206_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a> Here
is a savage frankness, with insensibility to shame. The
object avowed is hideous in every aspect, whether we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>
regard it as treason to our paternal government, as treason
to the idea of American institutions, or as treason
to those commanding principles of economy, morals, and
Christianity, without which civilization is no better than
barbarism.</p>

<p>And now we stand front to front in deadly conflict
with this double-headed, triple-headed treason. Beginning
with those States most peculiarly interested in
Slavery, and operating always with intensity proportioned
to the prevalence of Slavery, it fastens upon
other States less interested,&mdash;Tennessee, North Carolina,
Virginia,&mdash;and with much difficulty is prevented
from enveloping every State containing slaves, no matter
how few: for such is the malignant poison of Slavery
that only a few slaves constitute a Slave State with
all the sympathies and animosities of Slavery. This is
the Rebellion which I am to unmask. Bad as it is on
its face, it becomes aggravated, when we consider its
origin, and the agencies by which it is conducted. It
is not merely a Rebellion, but it is a Rebellion begun
in conspiracy; nor, in all history, ancient or modern,
is there any record of conspiracy so vast and so wicked,
ranging over such spaces both of time and territory, and
forecasting such results. A conspiracy to seize a castle
or to assassinate a prince is petty by the side of this
enormous, protracted treason, where half a continent is
seized, studded with castles, fortresses, and public edifices,
where the Government itself is overthrown, and
the President, on his way to the national capital, narrowly
escapes most cruel assassination.</p>

<p>But no conspiracy could ripen such pernicious fruit,
if not rooted in a soil of congenial malignity. To appreciate
properly this influence, we must go back to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>
beginning of the Government.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>South Carolina, which takes so forward a part in this
treason, hesitated originally, as is well known, with regard
to the Declaration of Independence. Once her
vote was recorded against this act; and when it finally
prevailed, her vote was given for it only formally and
for the sake of seeming unanimity.<a name="FNanchor_207_207" id="FNanchor_207_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a> But so little was
she inspired by the Declaration, that, in the contest
which ensued, her commissioners made a proposition to
the British commander which is properly characterized
by an able historian as “equivalent to an offer from the
State to return to its allegiance to the British crown.”<a name="FNanchor_208_208" id="FNanchor_208_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a>
The hesitation with regard to the Declaration of Independence
was renewed with regard to the National Constitution;
and here it was shared by another State. Notoriously,
both South Carolina and Georgia, which, with
the States carved from their original territory, Alabama
and Mississippi, constitute the chief seat of the conspiracy,
hesitated in becoming parties to the Union,
and stipulated expressly for recognition of the slave-trade
in the National Constitution as an indispensable
condition. In the Convention, Mr. Rutledge, of South
Carolina, while opposing a tax on the importation of
slaves, said: “The true question at present is, <em>whether
the Southern States</em> shall or shall not be parties to the
Union.” Mr. Pinckney, also of South Carolina, followed
with the unblushing declaration: “South Carolina can
never receive the plan [of the Constitution], <em>if it prohibits<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>
the slave-trade</em>.” I quote now from Mr. Madison’s
authentic report of these important debates.<a name="FNanchor_209_209" id="FNanchor_209_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a> With
shame let it be confessed, that, instead of repelling this
disgraceful overture, our fathers submitted to it, and
in that submission you find the beginning of present
sorrows. The slave-trade, whose annual iniquity no
tongue can tell, was placed for twenty years under
safeguard of the Constitution, thus giving sanction, support,
and increase to Slavery itself. The language is
modest, but the intent was complete. South Carolina
and Georgia were pacified, and took their places in
the Union, to which they were openly bound only by
a most hateful tie. Regrets for the past are not entirely
useless, if out of them we get wisdom for the
future, and learn to be brave. It is easy to see now,
that, had the unnatural pretensions of these States been
originally encountered by stern resistance worthy of an
honest people, the present conspiracy would have been
crushed before it saw the light. Its whole success,
from its distant beginning down to this hour, has been
from our timidity.</p>

<p>There was also another sentiment, of kindred perversity,
which prevailed in the same quarter. This
is vividly portrayed by John Adams, in a letter to
General Gates, dated at Philadelphia, 23d March,
1776:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“However, my dear friend Gates, all our misfortunes
arise from a single source: <em>the reluctance of the Southern
Colonies to Republican Government</em>.”<a name="FNanchor_210_210" id="FNanchor_210_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a></p>

</div>

<p>And he proceeds to declare in strong language that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span>“popular principles and axioms are abhorrent to the
inclinations of the barons of the South.” This letter
was written in the early days of the Revolution. At a
later date John Adams testifies again to the discord
between the North and the South, and refers particularly
to the period after the National Constitution, saying:
“The Northern and the Southern States were immovably
fixed in opposition to each other.”<a name="FNanchor_211_211" id="FNanchor_211_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_211_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a> This was
before any question of Tariff or Free Trade, and before
the growing fortunes of the North had awakened Southern
jealousy. The whole opposition had its root in Slavery,&mdash;as
also had the earlier resistance to Republican
Government.</p>

<p>In the face of these influences the Union was formed,
but the seeds of conspiracy were latent in its bosom.
The spirit already revealed was scarcely silenced; it
was not destroyed. It still existed, rankling, festering,
burning to make itself manifest. At the mention of
Slavery it always appeared full-armed with barbarous
pretensions. Even in the first Congress under the
Constitution, at the presentation of that famous petition
where Benjamin Franklin simply called upon Congress
to step to the verge of its power to discourage
every species of traffic in the persons of our fellow-men,
this spirit broke forth in violent threats. With
kindred lawlessness it early embraced that extravagant
dogma of State Rights which has been ever since the
convenient cloak of treason and conspiracy. At the
Missouri Question, in 1820, it openly menaced dissolution
of the Union. Instead of throttling the monster, we
submitted to feed it with new concessions. Meanwhile
the conspiracy grew, until, at last, in 1830, under the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span>
influence of Mr. Calhoun, it assumed the defiant front
of Nullification; nor did it yield to the irresistible logic
of Webster or the stern will of Jackson without a compromise.
The pretended ground of complaint was the
Tariff; but Andrew Jackson, himself a patriot Slaveholder,
at that time President, saw the hollowness of
the complaint. In a confidential letter, only recently
brought to light, dated at Washington, May 1, 1833,
and which during the last winter I had the honor of
reading and holding up before the Senatorial conspirators
in the original autograph, he says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The Tariff was only the <em>pretext</em>, and Disunion and a
Southern Confederacy the real object. <em>The next pretext will
be the Negro or Slavery Question.</em>”<a name="FNanchor_212_212" id="FNanchor_212_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Jackson was undoubtedly right; but the pretext
which he denounced in advance was employed so constantly
afterwards as to become threadbare. At the
earliest presentation of Abolition petitions,&mdash;at the
Texas Question,&mdash;at the Compromises of 1850,&mdash;at
the Kansas Question,&mdash;at the possible election of Fremont,&mdash;on
all these occasions, the Union was threatened
by angry Slave-Masters.</p>

<p>The conspiracy is unblushingly confessed by recent
parties to it. Especially was this done in the Rebel
Convention of South Carolina, where, one after another,
the witnesses testified all the same way.</p>

<p>Mr. Parker said: “Secession is no spasmodic effort
that has come suddenly upon us. <em>It has been gradually<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span>
culminating for a long period of thirty years.</em>”</p>

<p>Mr. Inglis followed: “Most of us have had this matter
under consideration for <em>the last twenty years</em>.”</p>

<p>Mr. Keitt, Representative in Congress, gloried in his
work, saying: “I have been engaged in this movement
<em>ever since I entered political life</em>.”</p>

<p>Mr. Rhett, who was in the Senate when I first entered
that body, and did not hesitate then to avow himself
a Disunionist, declared in the same Convention:
“It is not anything produced by Mr. Lincoln’s election,
or by the non-execution of the Fugitive Slave Law: <em>it
is a matter which has been gathering head for thirty
years</em>.”<a name="FNanchor_213_213" id="FNanchor_213_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a></p>

<p>The conspiracy, thus exposed by Jackson, and confessed
by recent parties to it, was quickened by the
growing passion for Slavery throughout the Slave States.
The well-known opinions of the Fathers, the declared
convictions of all most valued at the foundation of the
Government, and the example of Washington were discarded,
and it was recklessly avowed that Slavery is
a divine institution, the highest type of civilization,
a blessing to master and slave alike, and the very
key-stone of our national arch. A generation has
grown up with this teaching, so that it is now ready
to say with Satan,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Evil, be thou my good! by thee at least</div>
<div class="verse">Divided empire with Heaven’s King I hold;</div>
<div class="verse">By thee, and more than half perhaps, will reign:</div>
<div class="verse">As man, erelong, and this new world, shall know.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">It is natural that a people thus trained should listen
to the voice of conspiracy. Slavery itself is a constant
conspiracy; and its supporters, whether in the
Slave States or elsewhere, easily become indifferent to
all rights and principles by which it may be constrained.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span></p>

<p>This rage for Slavery was quickened by two influences,
which have exhibited themselves since the formation
of our Union,&mdash;one economical, and the other
political. The first was the unexpected importance of
the cotton crop, which, through the labor of slaves and
the genius of a New England inventor, passed into
an extraordinary element of wealth and of imagined
strength, so that we have all been summoned to homage
to cotton as king. The second was the temptation
of political power, than which no influence is more potent,&mdash;for
it became obvious that this could be assured
to Slavery only through the permanent preponderance
of its representatives in the Senate; so that the continued
control of all offices and honors was made to
depend upon the extension of Slavery. Thus, through
two strong appetites, one for gain and the other for
power, was Slavery stimulated; but the conspiracy was
strong only through Slavery.</p>

<p>Even this conspiracy, thus supported and nurtured,
would have been more wicked than strong, if it had
not found perfidious aid in the very Cabinet of the
President. The Secretary of the Treasury, a Slave-Master
from Georgia, the Secretary of the Interior, a
Slave-Master from Mississippi, the Secretary of War,
the notorious Floyd, a Slave-Master from Virginia, and
I fear also the Secretary of the Navy, who was a
Northern man with Southern principles, lent their active
exertions. Through these eminent functionaries
the treason was organized and directed, while their
important posts were prostituted to its infamy. Here
again you see the extent of the conspiracy. Never before,
in any country, was there a similar crime which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span>
embraced so many persons in the highest places of
power, or took within its grasp so large a theatre of
human action. Anticipating the election of Mr. Lincoln,
the Cabinet conspirators prepared the way for
rebellion.</p>

<p>First, the army of the United States was so far dispersed
and exiled, that the commander-in-chief found
it difficult, during the recent anxious winter, to bring
together a thousand troops for the defence of the national
capital, menaced by the conspirators.</p>

<p>Secondly, the navy was so far scattered or dismantled,
that on the 4th of March, when the new Administration
came into power, there were no ships to enforce
the laws, collect the revenues, or protect the
national property in the Rebel ports. Out of seventy-two
vessels of war, counted as our navy, it appears that
the whole available force at home was reduced to the
steamer Brooklyn, carrying twenty-five guns, and the
store-ship Relief, carrying two guns.</p>

<p>Thirdly, the forts on the extensive Southern coast
were so far abandoned by the public force, that the
larger part, counting upwards of 1,200 cannon, and
built at a cost of more than six million dollars, became
at once an easy prey to the Rebels.</p>

<p>Fourthly, national arms were transferred from Northern
to Southern arsenals, so as to disarm the Free
States and equip the Slave States. This was done on
a large scale. Upwards of 115,000 arms, of the latest
and most approved pattern, were transferred from the
Springfield and Watervliet arsenals to different arsenals
in the Slave States, where they were seized by the
Rebels; and a quarter of a million percussion muskets
were sold to various Slave States for $2.50 a musket,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span>
when they were worth, it is said, on an average, $12.
Large quantities of cannon, mortars, powder, ball, and
shell received the same direction.</p>

<p>Fifthly, the National Treasury, so recently prosperous
beyond example, was disorganized and plundered
even to the verge of bankruptcy. Upwards of six millions
are supposed to have been stolen, and much of
this treasure doubtless went to help the work of Rebellion.</p>

<p>Thus, even before its outbreak, the conspiracy contrived
to degrade and despoil the Government, so as to
secure free course for the projected rebellion. The story
seems incredible. But it was not enough to disperse
the army, to scatter the navy, to abandon forts,
to disarm the Free States, and to rob the Treasury.
The President of the United States, solemnly sworn to
execute the laws, was won into a system of inactivity
amounting to practical abdication of his great trust.
He saw treason plotting to stab at the heart of his
country, saw conspiracy, daily, hourly, putting on the
harness of rebellion, but, though warned by the watchful
general-in-chief, he did nothing to arrest it, standing
always,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse indent2">“like a painted Jove,</div>
<div class="verse">With idle thunder in his lifted hand.”<a name="FNanchor_214_214" id="FNanchor_214_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_214_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a></div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Ay, more; instead of instant lightnings, smiting and
blasting in their fiery crash, which an indignant patriotism
would have hurled, he nodded sympathy and
acquiescence. No page of history is more melancholy,
because nowhere do we find a ruler who so completely
abandoned his country: not Charles the First in his
tyranny, not Louis the Sixteenth in his weakness. Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span>
Buchanan was advanced to power by Slave-Masters,
who knew well that he could be used for Slavery.
The Slaveholding conspirators were encouraged to sit
in his Cabinet, where they doubly betrayed their country,
first by evil counsels, and then by disclosing what
passed to distant Slaveholding confederates. The sudden
act of Major Anderson, in removing from Fort
Moultrie to Fort Sumter, and the sympathetic response
of an aroused people, compelled a change of
policy, and the Rebellion received its first check. After
painful struggle, it was decided at last that Fort
Sumter should be maintained. It is difficult to exaggerate
the importance of that decision, which, I believe,
was due mainly to an eminent Democrat,&mdash;General
Cass. This, at least, is true: it saved the national
capital.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the conspiracy increased in activity, mastering
State after State, gathering its forces and building
its batteries. The time had come for the tragedy to
begin. “At Nottingham,” says the great English historian,
speaking of King Charles the First, “he erected
his royal standard, the open signal of discord and civil
war throughout the kingdom.”<a name="FNanchor_215_215" id="FNanchor_215_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_215_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a> The same open signal
now came from Charleston, when the conspirators ran
up the Rattle-Snake flag, and directed their wicked
cannonade upon the small, half-famished garrison of
Sumter.</p>

<p>Were this done in the name of Revolution, or by
virtue of any revolutionary principle, it would assume
a familiar character. But such is not the case. It is
all done under pretence of constitutional right. The
forms of the Constitution are seized by the conspirators,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span>
as they have already seized everything else, and
wrested to the purposes of treason. It is audaciously
declared, that, under the existing Constitution, each
State, in the exercise of its own discretion, may withdraw
from the Union; and this asserted right of secession
is invoked as cover for Rebellion begun in conspiracy.
The election of Mr. Lincoln is made the <em>occasion</em>
for the exercise of this pretended right; certain opinions
at the North on the subject of Slavery are made
the <em>pretext</em>.</p>

<p>Who will not deny that this election can be a just
<em>occasion</em>?</p>

<p>Who will not condemn the <em>pretext</em>?</p>

<p>But both occasion and pretext are determined by
Slavery, and thus testify to the part it constantly performs.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The pretended right of secession is not less monstrous
than the pretext or the occasion; and this, too,
is born of Slavery. It belongs to that brood of assumptions
and perversions of which Slavery is prolific
parent. Wherever Slavery prevails, this pretended
right is recognized, and generally with an intensity proportioned
to the prevalence of Slavery,&mdash;as, for instance,
in South Carolina and Mississippi more intensely than
in Tennessee and Kentucky. It may be considered a
fixed part of the slaveholding system. A pretended
right to set aside the Constitution, to the extent of
breaking up the Government, is the natural companion
of the pretended right to set aside human nature, making
merchandise of men. They form a well-matched
couple, and travel well together,&mdash;destined to perish
together. If we do not overflow toward the former with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span>
the same indignation which we feel for the latter, it is
because its absurdity awakens our contempt. An English
poet of the last century exclaims, in mocking
verses,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Crowned be the man with lasting praise</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Who first contrived the pin,</div>
<div class="verse">To loose mad horses from the chaise,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">And save the necks within.”<a name="FNanchor_216_216" id="FNanchor_216_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_216_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a></div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Such is the impossible contrivance now attempted.
Nothing is clearer than that this pretension, if acknowledged,
leaves to every State the right to play the “mad
horse,” with very little chance of saving anything. It
takes from the Government not merely unity, but all
security of national life, and reduces it to the shadow
of a name, or, at best, a mere tenancy at will,&mdash;an
unsubstantial form, to be decomposed at the touch of
a single State. Of course, such an anarchical pretension,
so instinct with all the lawlessness of Slavery,
must be encountered peremptorily. It is not enough
to declare dissent. We must so conduct as not to give
it recognition or foothold. [<i>Applause.</i>]</p>

<p>Instead of scouting this pretension, and utterly spurning
it, new concessions to Slavery were gravely propounded
as the means of pacification,&mdash;like a new
sacrifice offered to an obscene divinity. It was argued,
that in this way the Border States at least might
be preserved to the Union, and some of the Cotton
States perhaps won back to duty: in other words,
that, in consideration of such concessions, these States
would consent to waive a present exercise of the pretended
right of secession. Against all such propositions,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span>
without considering their character, stands on
the threshold one obvious and imperative objection.
It is clear that the very bargain or understanding,
whether express or implied, is a recognition of this
pretended right, and that a State yielding only to such
appeal, and detained through concessions, practically
asserts the claim, and holds it for future exercise.
Thus a concession called small becomes infinite; for it
concedes the pretended right of secession, and makes
the permanence of the National Government impossible.
Amidst all the grave responsibilities of the hour,
we must take care that the life of the Republic is
sacredly preserved. But this would be sacrificed at
once, did we submit its existence to the conditions
proposed.</p>

<p>Looking at these concessions, I have always found
them utterly unreasonable and indefensible. I should
not expose them now, if they did not testify constantly
to the Origin and Mainspring of this Rebellion. Slavery
was always the single subject-matter, and nothing
else. Slavery was not only an integral part of every
concession, but the single integer. The one idea was
to give some new security, in some form, to Slavery.
That brilliant statesman, Mr. Canning, in one of those
eloquent speeches which charm so much by style, said
that he was “tired of being a security-grinder”; but his
experience was not comparable to ours. “Security-grinding,”
in the name of Slavery, has been for years
the way in which we have wrestled with this conspiracy.
[<i>Laughter and applause.</i>]</p>

<p>The propositions at the last Congress began with the
President’s Message, which in itself was one tedious
concession. You cannot forget his sympathetic portraiture<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span>
of the disaffection throughout the Slave States,
or his testimony to the cause. Notoriously and shamefully
his heart was with the conspirators, and he knew
intimately the mainspring of their conduct. He proposed
nothing short of general surrender; and thus did
he proclaim Slavery as the head and front, the very
<i>causa causans</i>, of the whole crime.</p>

<p>Nor have you forgotten the Peace Conference, as it
was delusively styled, convened at Washington on the
summons of Virginia, with John Tyler in the chair,
where New York, as well as Massachusetts, was represented
by her ablest and most honored citizens. The
sessions were with closed doors; but it is now known
that throughout the proceedings, lasting for weeks, nothing
was discussed but Slavery. And the propositions
finally adopted by the Convention were confined to
Slavery. Forbearing all detail, it will be enough to
say that they undertook to provide positive protection
for Slavery under the Constitution, with new sanction
and immunity,&mdash;making it, notwithstanding the determination
of our fathers, <em>national</em> instead of <em>sectional</em>;
and even more, making it an essential and permanent
part of our republican system. Slavery is sometimes
deceitful, as at other times bold; and these propositions
were still further offensive from their studied uncertainty,
amounting to positive duplicity. At a moment
when frankness was needed above all things, we
were treated to phrases pregnant with doubt and controversy,
and were gravely asked, in the name of Slavery,
to embody them in the National Constitution.</p>

<p>There was another string of propositions much discussed
during the last winter, which acquired the name
of the venerable Senator from whom they came,&mdash;Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span>
Crittenden, of Kentucky. These also related to Slavery,
and nothing else. They were more obnoxious
even than those from the Peace Conference. And yet
there were petitioners from the North, even from Massachusetts,
who prayed for this great surrender. Considering
the character of these propositions,&mdash;that they
sought to change the Constitution in a manner revolting
to the moral sense, to foist into its very body
the idea of property in man, to protect Slavery in all
present territory south of 36° 30´, and to carry it into
all territory hereafter acquired south of that line, and
thus to make our beautiful Stars and Stripes in their
southern march the flag of infamy,&mdash;considering that
they provided new constitutional securities for Slavery
in the national capital and in other places within
the exclusive national jurisdiction, new constitutional
securities for the transit of slaves from State to State,
opening the way to a roll-call of slaves at the foot of
Bunker Hill or the door of Faneuil Hall, and also the
disfranchisement of nearly ten thousand of my fellow-citizens
in Massachusetts, whose rights are fixed by the
Constitution of that Commonwealth, drawn by John
Adams,&mdash;considering these things, I felt at the time,
and I still feel, that the best apology of these petitioners
was that they were ignorant of their true character,
and that in signing the petition they knew not what
they did. But even in their ignorance they bore witness
to Slavery, while the propositions were the familiar
voice of Slavery, crying, “Give! give!”</p>

<p>There was another single proposition from still another
quarter, but, like all the rest, it related exclusively
to Slavery. It was to insert in the text of the Constitution
a stipulation against any future amendment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span>
authorizing Congress to interfere with Slavery in the
States. If you read this proposition, you will find it
crude and ill-shaped,&mdash;a jargon of bad grammar, a
jumble and hodge-podge of words,&mdash;harmonizing poorly
with the accurate text of our Constitution. But even
if tolerable in form, it was obnoxious, like the rest, as a
fresh stipulation in favor of Slavery. Sufficient, surely,
in this respect, is the actual Constitution. Beyond this
I cannot I will not go. What Washington, Franklin,
Madison, and Hamilton would not insert we cannot err
in rejecting. [<i>Applause.</i>]</p>

<p>I do not dwell on other propositions, because they
attracted less attention; and yet among these was one
to overturn the glorious safeguards of Freedom set up
in the Free States, known as the Personal Liberty Laws.
Here again was Slavery&mdash;with a vengeance.</p>

<p>There is one remark which I desire to make with
regard to all these propositions. It was sometimes
said that the concessions they offered were “small.”
What a mistake is this! No concession to Slavery
can be “small.” Freedom is priceless, and in this simple
rule alike of morals and jurisprudence you find
the just measure of any concession, how small soever
it may seem, by which Freedom is sacrificed. Tell
me not that it concerns a few only. I do not forget
the saying of Antiquity, that the best government is
where an injury to a single individual is resented as an
injury to the whole State; nor am I indifferent to that
memorable instance of our own recent history, where, in
a distant sea, the thunders of our navy, with all the hazards
of war, were aroused to protect the liberty of a solitary
person claiming the rights of an American citizen.
By such examples let me be guided, rather than by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span>
suggestion, that Human Freedom, whether in many or
in few, is of so little value that it may be put in the
market to appease a traitorous conspiracy, or soothe
accessories, who, without such concession, threaten to
join the conspirators.</p>

<p>Warnings of the past, like the suggestions of reason
and of conscience, were all against concession. Timid
counsels always are an encouragement to sedition and
rebellion. If the glove be of velvet, the hand must be
of iron. An eminent master of thought, in some of his
most vivid words, has bravely said,&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“To expect to tranquillize and benefit a country by gratifying
its agitators would be like the practice of the superstitious
of old with their sympathetic powders and ointments,
who, instead of applying medicaments to the wound, contented
themselves with salving the sword which had inflicted
it. Since the days of Dane-gelt downwards, nay, since the
world was created, nothing but evil has resulted from concessions
made to intimidation.”<a name="FNanchor_217_217" id="FNanchor_217_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_217_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a></p>

</div>

<p>These are the words of Archbishop Whately, in his
annotation to an Essay of Bacon,&mdash;and how applicable
to our times, when it is so often proposed <em>to salve the
sword of Secession</em>!</p>

<p>In the same spirit spoke the most shining practical
statesman of English history, Mr. Fox.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“To humor the present disposition, and temporize, is a
certain, absolutely certain, confirmation of the evil. No
nation ever did or ever can recover from Slavery by such
methods.”<a name="FNanchor_218_218" id="FNanchor_218_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_218_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Pardon me, if I express regret, profound and heartfelt,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span>that the pretensions of Slavery, whether in claim
of privilege or in doctrine of secession, were not always
encountered boldly and austerely. Alas! it is
ourselves that have encouraged the conspiracy, and
made it strong. Secession has become possible only
through long continued concession. In proposing concession
we encourage secession, and while professing
to uphold the Union, we betray it. It is now beyond
question that the concessionists of the North have
from the beginning played into the hands of the secessionists
of the South. I do not speak in harshness,
or even in criticism, but simply according to my duty,
in unfolding historically the agencies, conscious and unconscious,
at work, while I hold them up as a warning
for the future. They all testify to Slavery, which from
earliest days has been at the bottom of the conspiracy,
and also at every stage of the efforts to arrest it. It
was Slavery which fired the conspirators, and Slavery
also which entered into every proposition of compromise.
Secession and concession both had their root
in Slavery.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>And now, after this review, I am brought again to
the significance of that Presidential election with which
I began. The Slave-Masters entered into that election
with Mr. Breckinridge as their candidate, and their
platform claimed constitutional protection for Slavery
in all territories, whether now belonging to the Republic
or hereafter acquired. This concession was the ultimatum
on which was staked their continued loyalty
to the Union,&mdash;as the continuance of the Slave-Trade
was the original condition on which South Carolina and
Georgia entered the Union. And the reason, though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span>
criminal, was obvious. It was because without such
opportunity of expansion Slavery would be stationary,
while the Free States, increasing in number, would obtain
a fixed preponderance in the National Government,
assuring to them the political power. Thus at that
election the banner of the Slave-Masters had for open
device, not the Union as it is, but the extension and
perpetuation of human bondage. The popular vote was
against further concession, and the conspirators proceeded
with their crime. The <em>occasion</em> so long sought had
come. The <em>pretext</em> foreseen by Andrew Jackson was
the motive power.</p>

<p>Here mark well, that, in their whole conduct, the
conspirators acted naturally, under instincts implanted
by Slavery; nay, they acted logically even. <em>Such is
Slavery, that it cannot exist, unless it owns the Government.</em>
An injustice so plain can find protection only
from a Government which is a reflection of itself. Cannibalism
cannot exist except under a government of
cannibals. Idolatry cannot exist except under a government
of idolaters. And Slavery cannot exist except
under a government of Slave-Masters. This is positive,
universal truth,&mdash;at St. Petersburg, Constantinople,
Timbuctoo, or Washington. The Slave-Masters of our
country saw that they were dislodged from the National
Government, and straightway they rebelled. The Republic,
which they could no longer rule, they determined
to ruin. And now the issue is joined. Slavery must
either rule or die.</p>

<p>Though thus audaciously criminal, the Slave-Masters
are not strong in numbers. The whole number, great
and small, according to the recent census, is not more
than four hundred thousand,&mdash;of whom there are less<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span>
than one hundred thousand interested to any considerable
extent in this peculiar species of property.<a name="FNanchor_219_219" id="FNanchor_219_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_219_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a> And
yet this petty oligarchy&mdash;itself controlled by a squad
still more petty&mdash;in a population of many millions,
has aroused and organized this gigantic rebellion. But
success is explained by two considerations. First, the
asserted value of the slaves, reaching at this date to
the enormous sum-total of two thousand millions of
dollars, constitutes an overpowering property interest,
one of the largest in the world,&mdash;greatly increased
by the intensity and unity of purpose naturally belonging
to the representatives of such a sum-total,
stimulated by the questionable character of the property.
But, secondly, it is a phenomenon attested by
the history of revolutions, that all such movements,
at least in their early days, are controlled by minorities.
This is because a revolutionary minority, once
embarked, has before it only the single, simple path of
unhesitating action. While others doubt or hold back,
the minority strikes and goes forward. Audacity then
counts more than numbers, and crime counts more than
virtue. This phenomenon has been observed before.
“Often have I reflected with awe,” says Coleridge, “on
the great and disproportionate power which an individual
of no extraordinary talents or attainments may
exert by merely throwing off all restraint of conscience.…
The abandonment of all <em>principle of right</em> enables
the soul to choose and act upon <em>a principle of
wrong</em>, and to subordinate to this one principle all the
various vices of human nature.”<a name="FNanchor_220_220" id="FNanchor_220_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_220_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a> These are remarkable
and most suggestive words. But when was a “principle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span>
of wrong” followed with more devotion than by our
Rebels?</p>

<p>The French Revolution furnishes authentic illustration
of a few predominating over a great change. Among
the good men at that time who followed “principle of
right” were others with whom success was the primary
object, while even good men sometimes forgot goodness;
but at each stage a minority gave the law. Pétion, the
famous mayor of Paris, boasted, that, when he began,
“there were but five men in France who wished a Republic.”<a name="FNanchor_221_221" id="FNanchor_221_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_221_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a>
From a contemporary debate in the British
Parliament, it appears that the asserted power of a minority
was made the express ground of appeal by French
revolutionists to the people of other countries. Sheridan,
in a brilliant speech, dwells on this appeal, and by
mistake ascribes to Condorcet the unequivocal utterances,
that “revolutions must always be the work of
the minority,”&mdash;that “every revolution is the work
of a minority,”&mdash;that “the French Revolution was
accomplished by the minority.”<a name="FNanchor_222_222" id="FNanchor_222_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_222_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a> This philosopher,
who sealed his principles by a tragical death, did say,
in an address to the Parliamentary Reformers of England,
that from Parliamentary reform “the passage to
the complete establishment of a republic would be short
and easy”;<a name="FNanchor_223_223" id="FNanchor_223_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_223_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a> but it was Cambon, the financier of the
Revolution, and one of its active supporters, who, in the
National Convention, put forth the cries attributed to
Condorcet.<a name="FNanchor_224_224" id="FNanchor_224_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_224_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a> The part of the minority was also attested
by Brissot de Warville, who imputed the triumph of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span>
Jacobins, under whose bloody sway his own life became
a sacrifice, to “some twenty men,” or, as he says in another
place, “a score of anarchists,” and then again, “a
club, or rather a score of those robbers who direct that
club.”<a name="FNanchor_225_225" id="FNanchor_225_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_225_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a></p>

<p>The future historian will record, that the present rebellion,
notwithstanding its protracted origin, the multitudes
it enlisted, and its extensive sweep, was at last
precipitated by fewer than twenty men,&mdash;Mr. Everett
says by as few as eight or ten.<a name="FNanchor_226_226" id="FNanchor_226_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_226_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a> It is certain that thus
far it has been the triumph of a minority,&mdash;but of a
minority moved, inspired, combined, and aggrandized by
Slavery.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>And now this traitorous minority, putting aside the
sneaking, slimy devices of conspiracy, steps forth in full
panoply of war. Assuming all functions of government,
it organizes States under a common head,&mdash;sends
ambassadors into foreign countries,&mdash;levies taxes,&mdash;borrows
money,&mdash;issues letters of marque,&mdash;and sets
armies in the field, summoned from distant Georgia,
Louisiana, and Texas, as well as from nearer Virginia,
and composed of the whole lawless population, the
poor who cannot own slaves as well as the rich who
pretend to own them, throughout the extensive region
where with Satanic grasp this Slave-Master minority
claims for itself</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse indent1">“ample room and verge enough</div>
<div class="verse">The characters of Hell to trace.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span></p>

<p>Pardon the language I employ. The words of the
poet picture not too strongly the object proposed. And
now these parricidal hosts stand arrayed against that
paternal Government to which they owe loyalty, defence,
and affection. Never in history did rebellion
assume such front. Call their number 400,000 or
200,000,&mdash;what you will,&mdash;they far surpass any armed
forces ever before marshalled in rebellion; they are
among the largest ever marshalled in war.</p>

<p>All this is in the name of Slavery, and for the sake
of Slavery, and at the bidding of Slavery. The profligate
favorite of the English monarch, the famous Duke
of Buckingham, was not more exclusively supreme,
even according to the words by which he was placarded
to the judgment of his contemporaries:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Who rules the kingdom? The King.</div>
<div class="verse">Who rules the King? <em>The Duke.</em></div>
<div class="verse">Who rules the Duke? The Devil.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Nor according to that decree by which the House
of Commons declared him “the cause of all the national
calamities.” The dominant part of the royal
favorite belongs now to Slavery, which is the cause of
all the national calamities, while in the Rebel States it
is a more than royal favorite.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Who rules the Rebel States? The President.</div>
<div class="verse">Who rules the President? <em>Slavery.</em></div>
<div class="verse">Who rules Slavery?</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The last question I need not answer. But all must
see&mdash;and nobody will deny&mdash;that Slavery is the ruling
idea of this Rebellion. It is Slavery that marshals
these hosts and breathes into their embattled ranks
its own barbarous fire. It is Slavery that stamps its
character alike upon officers and men. It is Slavery
that inspires all, from General to trumpeter. It is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</a></span>
Slavery that speaks in the word of command, and
sounds in the morning drum-beat. It is Slavery that
digs trenches and builds hostile forts. It is Slavery
that pitches its wicked tents and stations its sentries
over against the national capital. It is Slavery that
sharpens the bayonet and runs the bullet,&mdash;that points
the cannon, and scatters the shell, blazing, bursting
with death. Wherever this Rebellion shows itself, whatever
form it takes, whatever thing it does, whatever it
meditates, it is moved by Slavery; nay, the Rebellion
is Slavery itself, incarnate, living, acting, raging, robbing,
murdering, according to the essential law of its
being. [<i>Applause.</i>]</p>

<p>Not this is all. The Rebellion is not only ruled
by Slavery, but, owing to the peculiar condition of
the Slave States, it is for the moment, according to
their instinctive boast, actually reinforced by this institution.
As the fields of the South are cultivated
by slaves, and labor there is performed by this class,
the white freemen are at liberty to play the part of
rebels. The slaves toil at home, while the masters
work at rebellion; and thus, by singular fatality, is
this doomed race, without taking up arms, actually
engaged in feeding, supporting, succoring, invigorating
those battling for their enslavement. Full well I know
that this is an element of strength only through the
forbearance of our own Government; but I speak of
things as they are; and that I may not seem to go
too far, I ask attention to the testimony of a Southern
journal.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<span class="smcap">The Slaves as a Military Element in the South</span>&mdash;The
total white population of the eleven States now comprising
the Confederacy is six millions, and therefore, to fill
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</a></span>up the ranks of the proposed army, six hundred thousand&mdash;about
ten per cent of the entire white population&mdash;will be
required. In any other country than our own such a draft
could not be met; but the Southern States can furnish that
number of men, and still not leave the material interests of
the country in a suffering condition. Those who are incapacitated
for bearing arms can oversee the plantations, and
<em>the negroes can go on undisturbed in their usual labors</em>. In
the North the case is different; the men who join the army
of subjugation are the laborers, the producers, and the factory
operatives. Nearly every man from that section, especially
those from the rural districts, leaves some branch of
industry to suffer during his absence. <em>The institution of
Slavery in the South alone enables her to place in the field a
force much larger in proportion to her white population than
the North</em>, or indeed any country which is dependent entirely
on free labor. The institution is a tower of strength
to the South, <em>particularly at the present crisis</em>, and our enemies
will be likely to find that the ‘moral cancer,’ about
which their orators are so fond of prating, is really <em>one of
the most effective weapons employed against the Union by the
South</em>. Whatever number of men be needed for this war
we are confident our people stand ready to furnish. We
are all enlisted for the war, and there must be no holding
back, until the independence of the South is fully acknowledged.”<a name="FNanchor_227_227" id="FNanchor_227_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_227_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a></p>

</div>

<p>As the Rebels have already confessed the conspiracy
which led to the Rebellion, so in this article do they
openly confess the mainspring of their power. With
triumphant vaunt, they declare Slavery the special
source of their belligerent strength.</p>

<p>But Slavery must be seen not only in what it does
for the Rebellion, of which it is indisputable head,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</a></span>
fountain, and life, but also in what it inflicts upon
us. There is not a community, not a family, not an
individual, man, woman, or child, that does not feel its
heavy, bloody hand. Why these mustering armies?
Why this drum-beat in your peaceful streets? Why
these gathering means of war? Why these swelling
taxes? Why these unprecedented loans? Why this
derangement of business? Why among us <i>Habeas
Corpus</i> suspended, and all safeguards of Freedom prostrate?
Why this constant solicitude visible in your
faces? The answer is clear. Slavery is author, agent,
cause. The anxious hours that you pass are darkened
by Slavery. <i>Habeas Corpus</i> and the safeguards of Freedom
which you deplore are ravished by Slavery. The
business you have lost is filched by Slavery. The
millions now amassed by patriotic offerings are all
snatched by Slavery. The taxes now wrung out of
diminished means are all consumed by Slavery. And
all these multiplying means of war, this drum-call in
your peaceful streets and these gathering armies, are
on account of Slavery, and that alone. Are the poor
constrained to forego their customary tea, or coffee, or
sugar, now burdened by intolerable taxation? Let them
vow themselves anew against the criminal giant tax-gatherer.
Does any community mourn gallant men,
who, going forth joyous and proud beneath their country’s
flag, have been brought home cold and stiff, with
its folds wrapped about them for a shroud? Let all
mourning the patriot dead be aroused against Slavery.
Does a mother drop tears for her son in the beautiful
morning of his days cut down upon the distant battle-field,
which he moistens with his youthful, generous
blood? Let her feel that Slavery dealt the deadly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span>
blow which took at once his life and her peace. [<i>Sensation.</i>]</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I hear a strange, discordant voice saying that all
this proceeds not from Slavery,&mdash;oh, no!&mdash;but from
Antislavery,&mdash;that the Republicans, who hate Slavery,
that the Abolitionists, are authors of this terrible
calamity. You must suspect the sense or loyalty of
him who puts forth this irrational and utterly wicked
imputation. As well say that the early Christians were
authors of the heathen enormities against which they
bore martyr testimony, and that the cross, the axe, the
gridiron, and the boiling oil, by which they suffered,
were part of the Christian dispensation. But the early
Christians were misrepresented and falsely charged with
crime, even as you are. The tyrant Nero, after burning
Rome and dancing at the conflagration, denounced Christians
as the guilty authors. Here are authentic words
by the historian Tacitus.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“So, for the quieting of this rumor, Nero judicially charged
with the crime, and punished with most studied severities,
that class, hated for their general wickedness, whom the
vulgar call Christians. The originator of that name was
one Christ, who, in the reign of Tiberius, suffered death by
sentence of the procurator Pontius Pilate. The baneful
superstition, thereby repressed for the time, again broke out,
not only over Judea, the native soil of that mischief, but in
the city also, where from every side all atrocious and abominable
things collect and flourish.”<a name="FNanchor_228_228" id="FNanchor_228_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_228_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The writer of this remarkable passage was the wisest
and most penetrating mind of his generation, and he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</a></span>
lived close upon the events which he describes. Listening
to him, you may find apology for those among
us who heap upon contemporaries similar obloquy.
Abolitionists need no defence from me. It is to their
praise&mdash;destined to fill an immortal page&mdash;that from
the beginning they saw the true character of Slavery,
and warned against its threatening domination.
Through them the fires of Liberty have been kept
alive in our country,&mdash;as Hume is constrained to
confess that these same fires were kept alive in
England by the Puritans, whom this great historian
never praised, if he could help it. And yet they are
charged with this Rebellion. Can this be serious?
Even at the beginning of the Republic the seeds of
the conspiracy were planted, and in 1820, and again
in 1830, it appeared,&mdash;while nearly thirty years ago
Andrew Jackson denounced it, and one of its leading
spirits recently boasted that it has been gathering
head for this full time, thus, not only in distant
embryo, but in well-attested development, antedating
those Abolitionists whose prophetic patriotism is made
an apology for the crime. As well, when the prudent
passenger warns the ship’s crew of the fatal lee-shore,
arraign him for the wreck which engulfs all; as well
cry out, that the philosopher who foresees the storm is
responsible for the desolation that ensues, or that the
astronomer, who calculates the eclipse, is author of the
darkness which covers the earth. [<i>Enthusiastic applause.</i>]</p>

<p>Nothing can surpass that early contumely to which
Christians were exposed. To the polite heathen, they
were only “workers in wool, cobblers, fullers, the rudest
and most illiterate persons,”<a name="FNanchor_229_229" id="FNanchor_229_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_229_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a> or they were men and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</a></span>
women “from the lowest dregs.”<a name="FNanchor_230_230" id="FNanchor_230_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_230_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a> Persecution naturally
followed, not only local, but general. As many
as ten persecutions are cited,&mdash;two under mild rulers
like Trajan and Hadrian,&mdash;while, at the atrocious command
of Nero, Christians, wrapped in pitch, were set
on fire as lights to illumine the public gardens. And
yet against contumely and persecution Christianity prevailed,
and the name of Christian became an honor
which confessors and martyrs wore as a crown. But
this painful history prefigures that of our Abolitionists,
who have been treated with similar contumely;
nor have they escaped persecution. At last the time
has come when their cause must prevail, and their
name become an honor.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>And now, that I may give practical character to this
whole history, I bring it all to bear upon our present
situation and its duties. You have discerned Slavery,
even before the National Union, not only a disturbing
influence, but an actual bar to Union, except on condition
of surrender to its immoral behests. You have
watched Slavery constantly militant on the presentation
of any proposition with regard to it, and more than
once threatening dissolution of the Union. You have
discovered Slavery for many years the animating principle
of a conspiracy against the Union, while it matured
flagitious plans and obtained the mastery of Cabinet
and President. And when the conspiracy had
balefully ripened, you have seen how only by concessions
to Slavery it was encountered, as by similar concessions
it had from the beginning been encouraged.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</a></span>
Now you behold Rebellion everywhere throughout the
Slave States elevating its bloody crest and threatening
the existence of the National Government, and all in
the name of Slavery, while it sets up a pretended Government
whose corner-stone is Slavery. [<i>Hisses, and
cries of “Never!”</i>]</p>

<p>Against this Rebellion we wage war. It is our determination,
as it is our duty, to crush it; and this will be
done. Nor am I disturbed by any success which the
Rebels may seem to obtain. The ancient Roman, who,
confident in the destiny of the Republic, bought the
field on which the conquering Hannibal was encamped,
is a fit example for us. I would not have less trust
than his. The Rebel States are our fields. The region
now contested by the Rebels belongs to the United
States by every tie of government and of right. Some
of it has been bought with our money, while all of it,
with its rivers, harbors, and extensive coast, has become
essential to our business in peace and to our defence
in war. Union is a geographical, economical,
commercial, political, military, and (if I may so say)
even a fluvial necessity. Without union, peace on this
continent is impossible; but life without peace is impossible
also.</p>

<p>Only by crushing this Rebellion can union and peace
be restored. Let this be seen in its reality, and who
can hesitate? If this were done instantly, without
further contest, then, besides all the countless advantages
of every kind obtained by such restoration, two
special goods will be accomplished,&mdash;one political, and
the other moral as well as political. First, the pretended
right of secession, with the whole pestilent extravagance
of State sovereignty, supplying the machinery<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</a></span>
for this Rebellion, and affording a delusive cover for
treason, will be trampled out, never again to disturb
the majestic unity of the Republic; and, secondly, the
unrighteous attempt to organize a new confederacy,
solely for the sake of Slavery, and with Slavery as its
corner-stone, will be overthrown. These two pretensions,
one so shocking to our reason and the other so
shocking to our moral nature, will disappear forever.
And with their disappearance will date a new epoch,
the beginning of a grander age. If by any accident
the Rebellion should prevail, then, just in proportion
to its triumph, through concession on our part or
successful force on the other part, will the Union be
impaired and peace be impossible. Therefore in the
name of the Union and for the sake of peace are you
summoned to the work.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>But how shall the Rebellion be crushed? That is
the question. Men, money, munitions of war, a well-supplied
commissariat, means of transportation,&mdash;all
these you have in abundance, in some particulars beyond
the Rebels. You have, too, the consciousness of a
good cause, which in itself is an army. And yet thus
far, until within a few days, the advantage has not been
on our side. The explanation is easy. The Rebels are
combating at home, on their own soil, strengthened and
maddened by Slavery, which is to them ally and fanaticism.
More thoroughly aroused than ourselves, more terribly
in earnest, with every sinew vindictively strained
to its most perfect work, they freely use all the means
that circumstances put into their hands,&mdash;not only
raising against us their white population, but fellowshipping
the savagery of the Indian, cruising upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</a></span>
sea in pirate ships to despoil our commerce, and at
one swoop confiscating our property to the amount of
hundreds of millions, while all this time their four
million slaves undisturbed at home freely contribute
by their labor to sustain the war, which without them
must soon expire.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It remains for us to encounter the Rebellion calmly
and surely by a force superior to its own. To this end,
something more is needed than men or money. Our
battalions must be reinforced by ideas, and we must
strike directly at the Origin and Mainspring. I do not
say now in what way or to what extent, but only that
we must strike: it may be by the system of a Massachusetts
General,&mdash;Butler; it may be by that of Fremont
[<i>here the audience rose and gave long continued cheers</i>];
or it may be by the grander system of John Quincy
Adams. Reason and sentiment both concur in this
policy, which is according to the most common principles
of human conduct. In no way can we do so
much at so little cost. To the enemy such a blow will
be a terror, to good men it will be an encouragement,
and to foreign nations watching this contest it will be
an earnest of something beyond a mere carnival of battle.
There has been the cry, “On to Richmond!” and
still another worse cry, “On to England!” Better than
either is the cry, “On to Freedom!”<a name="FNanchor_231_231" id="FNanchor_231_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_231_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a> [<i>Tremendous
cheering.</i>] Let this be heard in the voices of our soldiers,
ay, let it resound in the purposes of the Government,
and victory must be near.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</a></span></p>

<p>With no little happiness I make known that this cry
begins at last to be adopted. It is in the instructions
from the Secretary of War, dated War Department,
October 14, 1861, and addressed to the General commanding
the forces about to embark for South Carolina.
Here are the important words.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“You will, however, in general, avail yourself of the services
of any persons, whether fugitives from labor or not,
who may offer them to the National Government; you will
employ such persons in such services as they may be fitted
for, either as ordinary employees, or, if special circumstances
seem to require it, in any other capacity, with such organization,
in squads, companies, or otherwise, as you deem most
beneficial to the service. This, however, not to mean a
general arming of them for military service. You will assure
all loyal masters that Congress will provide just compensation
to them for the loss of the services of the persons
so employed.”<a name="FNanchor_232_232" id="FNanchor_232_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_232_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a></p>

</div>

<p>This is not the positive form of proclamation; but
analyze the words, and you will find them full of meaning.
First, Martial Law is declared; for the powers
committed to the discretion of the General are derived
from that law, and not from the late Confiscation Act
of Congress. Secondly, fugitive slaves are not to be
surrendered. Thirdly, all coming within the camp are
to be treated as freemen. Fourthly, they may be employed
in such service as they are fitted for. Fifthly,
in squads, companies, or otherwise, with the single
slight limitation that this is not to mean “a <em>general</em>
arming of them for military service.” And, sixthly,
compensation, through Congress, is promised to loyal
masters,&mdash;saying nothing of Rebel masters. All this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</a></span>
falls little short of a Proclamation of Emancipation,&mdash;not
unlike that of old Caius Marius, when, landing
on the coast of Etruria, according to Plutarch, he proclaimed
liberty to the slaves. As such, I do not err,
when I call it, thus far, the most important event of
the war,&mdash;more important because understood to have
the deliberate sanction of the President as well as of
the Secretary, and therefore marking the policy of the
Administration. That this policy should be first applied
to South Carolina is just. As the great Rebellion
began in this State, so should the great remedy.
[<i>Applause and cheers.</i>]</p>

<p>Slavery is the inveterate culprit, the transcendent
criminal, the persevering traitor, the wicked parricide,
the arch rebel, the open outlaw. As the less is contained
in the greater, so the Rebellion is all contained
in Slavery. The tenderness which you show to Slavery
is, therefore, indulgence to the Rebellion itself.
[<i>Applause.</i>] The pious caution with which you avoid
harming Slavery exceeds that ancient superstition which
made the wolf sacred among the Romans and the crocodile
sacred among the Egyptians; nor shall I hesitate
to declare that every surrender of a slave back to bondage
is an offering of human sacrifice, whose shame
is too great for any army to bear. That men should
hesitate to strike at Slavery is only another illustration
of human weakness. The English Republicans, in
bloody contest with the Crown, hesitated for a long
time to fire upon the King; but under the valiant lead
of Cromwell, surrounded by his well-trained Ironsides,
they banished all such scruple, and you know the result.
The King was not shot, but his head was brought
to the block.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</a></span></p>
<p>The duty which I announce, if not urgent now, as a
MILITARY NECESSITY, <em>in just self-defence</em>, will present
itself constantly, <em>as our armies advance in the Slave
States or land on their coasts</em>. If it does not stare us in
the face at this moment, it is because unhappily we are
still everywhere on the defensive. As we begin to be
successful, it must rise before us for practical decision;
and we cannot avoid it. There will be slaves in our
camps, or within our extended lines, whose condition
we must determine. There will be slaves also claimed
by Rebels, whose continued chattelhood we should scorn
to recognize. The decision of these two cases will settle
the whole great question. Nor can the Rebels complain.
They challenge our armies to enter upon their
territory in the free exercise of all the powers of war,&mdash;according
to which, as you well know, all private interests
are subordinated to the public safety, which, for the
time, becomes the supreme law above all other laws and
above the Constitution itself. If everywhere under the
flag of the Union, in its triumphant march, Freedom
is substituted for Slavery, this outrageous Rebellion
will not be the first instance in history where God has
turned the wickedness of man into a blessing; nor will
the example of Samson stand alone, when he gathered
honey from the carcass of the dead and rotten lion.
[<i>Cheers.</i>]</p>

<p>Pardon me, if I speak in hints only, and do not
stop to argue or explain. Not now, at the close of
an evening devoted to the Rebellion in its Origin
and Mainspring, can I enter upon this great question
of military duty in its details. There is another place
where this discussion will be open for me.<a name="FNanchor_233_233" id="FNanchor_233_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_233_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a> [<i>Cheers.</i>]
It is enough now, if I indicate the simple principle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</a></span>
which is the natural guide of all really in earnest, of
all whose desire to save their country is stronger than
the desire to save Slavery. You will strike where the
blow is most felt; nor will you miss the precious opportunity.
The enemy is before you, nay, he comes out
in ostentatious challenge, and his name is Slavery.
You can vindicate the Union only by his prostration.
Slavery is the very Goliath of the Rebellion, armed
with coat of mail, with helmet of brass upon the head,
greaves of brass upon the legs, target of brass between
the shoulders, and with the staff of his spear
like a weaver’s beam. But a stone from a simple
sling will make the giant fall upon his face to the
earth. [<i>Prolonged cheering.</i>]</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Thank God, our Government is strong; but thus far
all signs denote that it is not strong enough to save the
Union, and at the same time save Slavery. One or the
other must suffer; and just in proportion as you reach
forth to protect Slavery do you protect this accursed
Rebellion, nay, you give to it that very aid and comfort
which are the constitutional synonym for treason itself.
Perversely and pitifully do you postpone that sure period
of reconciliation, not only between the two sections,
not only between the men of the North and the men
of the South, but, more necessary still, between slave
and master, without which the true tranquillity we all
seek cannot be permanently assured. Believe it, only
through such reconciliation, under sanction of Freedom,
can you remove all occasion of conflict hereafter; only
in this way can you cut off the head of this great Hydra,
and at the same time extirpate that principle of
evil, which, if allowed to remain, must shoot forth in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</a></span>
perpetual discord, if not in other rebellions; only in
this way can you command that safe victory, without
which this contest is vain, which will have among its
conquests Indemnity for the Past and Security for the
Future,&mdash;the noblest indemnity and the strongest security
ever won, because founded in the redemption of
race. [<i>Cheers.</i>]</p>

<p>Full well I know the doubts, cavils, and misrepresentations
to which this argument for the integrity of
the nation is exposed; but I turn with confidence to
the people. The heart of the people is right, and all
great thoughts come from the heart. All hating Slavery
and true to Freedom will join in effort, paying
with person, time, talent, purse. They are our minute-men,
always ready,&mdash;and yet more ready just in proportion
as the war is truly inspired. They, at least,
are sure. It remains that others not sharing this animosity,
merchants who study their ledgers, bankers
who study their discounts, and politicians who study
success, should see that only by prompt and united
effort against Slavery can the war be brought to a
speedy and triumphant close, without which, merchant,
banker, and politician all suffer alike. Ledger, discount,
and political aspiration will have small value,
if the war continues its lava flood, shrivelling and
stifling everything but itself. Therefore, <em>under spur of
self-interest, if not under the necessities of self-defence</em>,
we must act together. Humanity, too, joins in this
appeal. Blood enough has been shed, victims enough
have bled at the altar, even if you are willing to lavish
upon Slavery the tribute now paying of more than
a million dollars a day.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</a></span></p>
<p>Events, too, under Providence, are our masters. For
the Rebels there can be no success. For them every
road leads to disaster. For them defeat is bad, but
victory worse; for then will the North be inspired
to sublimer energy. The proposal of Emancipation
which shook ancient Athens followed close upon the
disaster at Chæronea; and the statesman who moved
it vindicated himself by saying that it proceeded not
from him, but from Chæronea<a name="FNanchor_234_234" id="FNanchor_234_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_234_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a>. The triumph of Hannibal
at Cannæ drove the Roman Republic to the enlistment
and enfranchisement of eight thousand slaves<a name="FNanchor_235_235" id="FNanchor_235_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_235_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a>.
Such is history, which we are now repeating. The recent
Act of Congress giving freedom to slaves <em>employed
against us</em>, familiarly known as the Confiscation Act,
passed the Senate on the morning after the disaster at
Manassas<a name="FNanchor_236_236" id="FNanchor_236_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_236_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a>. In the providence of God there are no accidents;
and this seeming reverse helped to the greatest
victory which can be won.</p>

<p>Do not forget, I pray you, that classical story of the
mighty hunter whose life in the Book of Fate was
made to depend upon the existence of a brand burning
at his birth. The brand, so full of destiny, was
snatched from the flames and carefully preserved by
his prudent mother. Meanwhile the hunter became
powerful and invulnerable to mortal weapon. But at
length the mother, indignant at his cruelty to her own
family, flung the brand upon the flames and the hunter
died. The life of Meleager, so powerful and invulnerable
to mortal weapon, is now revived in this Rebellion,
and Slavery is the fatal brand. Let the National
Government, whose maternal care is still continued<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</a></span>
to Slavery, simply throw the thing upon the
flames madly kindled by itself, and the Rebellion will
die at once. [<i>Sensation.</i>]</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Amidst all surrounding perils there is one only which
I dread. It is the peril from some new surrender to
Slavery, some fresh recognition of its power, some present
dalliance with its intolerable pretensions. Worse
than any defeat, or even the flight of an army, would
be this abandonment of principle. From all such peril,
good Lord, deliver us! And there is <em>one way of safety</em>,
clear as sunlight, pleasant as the paths of Peace.
Over its broad and open gate is written JUSTICE.
In that little word is victory. Do justice and you will
be twice victors; for so will you subdue the Rebel
master, while you elevate the slave. Do justice frankly,
generously, nobly, and you will find strength instead of
weakness, while all seeming responsibility disappears
in obedience to God’s eternal law. Do justice, though
the heavens fall. But they will not fall. Every act of
justice becomes a new pillar of the Universe, or it may
be a new link of that</p>

<h3>APPENDIX.</h3>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/line.png" width="80" height="16" alt="" />
</div>

<div class="medium">

<p>The bill to confiscate property used for insurrectionary purposes,
reported by Mr. Trumbull from the Judiciary Committee, came up in
regular order in the Senate, Monday, July 22, when, on his motion,
the following amendment was adopted, every Republican voting for it:
“That whenever any person, claiming to be entitled to the service or
labor of any other person under the laws of any State, shall employ
such person in aiding or promoting any insurrection, or in resisting the
laws of the United States, or shall permit him to be so employed, he
shall forfeit all right to such service or labor, and the person whose
labor or service is thus claimed shall be thenceforth discharged therefrom,
any law to the contrary notwithstanding.”<a name="FNanchor_237_237" id="FNanchor_237_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_237_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a> This very moderate
proposition was the beginning of Emancipation. In the House of Representatives
it was changed in form, but not in substance, and the Bill
was approved by the President August 6, 1861.<a name="FNanchor_238_238" id="FNanchor_238_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_238_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>This address appeared in numerous journals, and also in the <i>Rebellion
Record</i>, besides being circulated extensively in pamphlet form
at home and abroad. Evidently the hostility to Emancipation was
softening, although the old spirit found utterance in some of the
newspapers.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The <i>New York Herald</i> thus declared itself.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The Hon. Charles Sumner, the famous orator of the Satanic Abolition
school, which first introduced into our happy republic the elements of dismemberment
and dissolution, as the Old Serpent introduced sin and death into
the Garden of Eden, held forth last evening at the Cooper Institute before
the Young Men’s Republican Union of New York. His audience were Abolitionists
of the true-blue stamp, and the design of his harangue was to stir
up in this city mutiny and rebellion against the Government in the interest
of General Fremont, around whom the revolutionary forces of fanatical
Puritanism have been gathering ever since he issued his proclamation
emancipating the negroes of Missouri.…</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</a></span>

<p>“Till the head of the serpent of Abolitionism is crushed by the heel of
Abe Lincoln, there can be no salvation for the South, and no hope of redeeming
its rebels from the fatal error and delusion into which they have been
led by the Antislavery propagandists and sympathizers with John Brown.”</p>

</div>

<p>But this same journal spoke otherwise of the auditory.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Rarely has there been such a large audience assembled in the Cooper
Institute,&mdash;never one of such general reputation and intelligence. Several
hundred ladies were present. As Mr. Sumner made his appearance on the
platform, he was hailed with enthusiastic applause.”</p>

</div>

<p>The New York <i>Journal of Commerce</i> followed the <i>Herald</i>.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<em>It was a labored, but concealed, attack on the Constitution and its framers.</em>
Mr. Sumner did not dare speak his sentiments fully, and boldly attack
Washington and the illustrious Fathers. He preferred the insidious course
of instilling into the minds of his audience sentiments of hatred to the Constitution,
so that they might look complacently hereafter on the Abolition
revolution which he contemplates.”</p>

</div>

<p>An extract from the <i>Principia</i>, at New York, the organ of Abolitionists
insisting always upon the utter unconstitutionality of Slavery, will
suffice on the other side.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Our readers at a distance will be interested and encouraged to know
that the most radical portions of it received the most enthusiastic applause
from the immense assemblage, on that occasion, without eliciting the slightest
expression of dissent. This was remarkably true, even of that portion
of it which defended the Abolitionists from the charge of having caused our
present national troubles, and, on the contrary, gave them ample and due
credit for keeping alive the flame of Freedom by their opposition to Slavery,
and forewarning the country of the evils it was bringing upon us. To ourselves
and a remnant of our old associates, on the platform and in the meeting,
who remembered the scenes of mob violence in this city in 1833-34,
and the attempted renewal of the same riots in the same Cooper Institute
only about two years since, when Cheever and Phillips were interrupted
and threatened, the contrast was most striking and cheering.”</p>

</div>

<p>Correspondents expressed themselves warmly.</p>

<p>Richard Warren, of Plymouth stock, wrote from New York:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Congratulating you, Sir, and our country, that the day now seems not
far distant when America is to fulfil the destiny assigned to her, and be
throughout all her borders a land of freemen without slaves, and honoring
you for the labor you have so well performed in the past and in the present,
I have to express the gratification with which I listened to your true words
on Wednesday last in this city, and to subscribe myself as one who heard
you at Plymouth,<a name="FNanchor_239_239" id="FNanchor_239_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_239_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a> and who always hears you when opportunity offers.”</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</a></span></p>

<p>Richard J. Hinton, the courageous and liberal journalist, was moved
to write from Kansas:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Having just finished the perusal of your late oration in New York City,
I cannot let the opportunity pass of sending my thanks, and I know therein
I speak for Kansas, for the emphatic opinions and masterly <i>exposé</i> of the
cause of, and remedy for, this most stupendous rebellion. Such things as
you there so eloquently express give the soldiers of Freedom in Kansas heart
and courage in the work of giving Freedom to all.”</p>

</div>

<p>Orestes A. Brownson, whose able and learned pen was so active on
the same line with Mr. Sumner, wrote from Elizabeth, New Jersey:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I have read with great pleasure your discourse on the ‘Origin and Mainspring
of the Rebellion.’ It is conclusive, and powerfully so, and does you
infinite credit. I see you are afraid of some attempt at compromise. I am
very much afraid of it. There must be no compromise. The battle must be
fought out, and we must settle the question once and forever, whether we
are a nation or are not. Everything, I fear, depends on the vigilance, firmness,
and patriotism of Congress.”</p>

</div>

<p>Henry C. Wright, the veteran of Abolition, wrote:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I am sixty-four years old. Thirty of those years have been almost
exclusively spent in a war of ideas against Slavery, as a Garrisonian Abolitionist.
<em>Conquer by suffering! Victory or death! Resistance to tyrants,
obedience to God!</em> Such have been the watchwords of the battle. You
know what it has cost those who have waged this war of ideas. But I felt
fully rewarded last evening in seeing that audience so earnestly listening to
such sentiments as fell from your lips. What a revolution in thought and
feeling in twenty-five years! Never again let man be discouraged in a
conflict between <em>humanity</em> and its <em>incidents</em>.”</p>

</div>

<p>A citizen of Washington confessed the change in his mind from this
speech.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I have through all my life been a Democrat, and I confess I have had
no great love for you, or what I thought to be your principles. But a cardinal
principle in my ethics is, that men should always be ‘open to conviction.’
I am happy to confess that I have been doubly deceived: first, in
the principles and intentions of the Democratic party; and, second, in the
principles and intentions of the Republicans,&mdash;or Abolitionists, as we call
them. A friend handed me your great oration delivered in New York, and
I am so favorably struck with its logic and patriotism that I am completely
proselyted. Mr. Sumner, I want my children and my children’s children to
know that I am a ‘Sumner man.’”</p>

</div>

<p>These expressions from different parts of the country show the
wakeful sympathy which prevailed.</p>

December 4, 1861.</span></p>

</div>

<div class="medium">

<p>The first regular session of Congress, after the breaking out of the
Rebellion, opened on Monday, December 2, 1861. Mr. Sumner renewed
at once his movement against Slavery.</p>

<p>December 4th he submitted the following resolution, as a mode of
calling attention to an abuse, and of obtaining a hearing while he
exposed it.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<i>Resolved</i>, That the Secretary of War be requested to furnish to the
Senate copies of any General Orders in the military department of Missouri
relating to fugitive slaves.”</p>

</div>

<p>On this he spoke briefly.</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">MR. PRESIDENT,&mdash;My attention has been called,
by letter from St. Louis, to certain General Orders
purporting to be by Major-General Halleck, in command
of the Department of Missouri, relating to fugitive
slaves, wherein it is directed that such persons shall
not be received within his camps, or within the lines of
his forces when on march, and that any such persons
now within such lines shall be thrust out; and the
reason strangely assigned for this order is, that such
fugitive slaves will carry information to the Rebels.</p>

<p>It is difficult to speak of an order like this, and keep
within bounds. Beside being irrational and inhuman
on its face, it practically authorizes the surrender of
fugitive slaves beyond any constitutional obligation.
Such an order must naturally be disheartening to our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</a></span>
soldiers, and it gives a bad name to our country, both
at home and abroad.</p>

<p>General Halleck is reported to be a good tactician;
but an act like this, with which he chooses to inaugurate
his command, does not give assurance of great success
hereafter. He may be expert in details of military
science; but something more is needed now. Common
sympathy, common humanity, and common sense must
prevail in the conduct of this war. I take the liberty
of saying&mdash;and I wish that my words may reach his
distant head-quarters&mdash;that every fugitive slave he
surrenders will hereafter rise in judgment against him
with a shame which no possible victory can remove.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>A letter from St. Louis, written the day after these remarks, shows
the necessity for them, and also how promptly they reached Missouri,
thanks to the telegraph.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“We thank you most kindly for your motion yesterday, and I beg to
inclose you some extracts which will show you the workings of that unfortunate
Order No. 3. The slaves advertised, in some instances, to my own
knowledge, belong to Secessionists in Price’s army. For that matter, they
may all belong to that class of people. Is it not an inhuman act for these
poor people to be made outlaws for no crime, only that they refused to join
their traitor masters in onslaught on our beneficent Government?”</p>

DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA.</h2>

<p class="plabeln"><span class="smcap">Remarks in the Senate, on a Resolution for the Discharge of
Fugitive Slaves from the Washington Jail, December 4,
1861.</span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/line.png" width="80" height="16" alt="" />
</div>

<div class="medium">

<p>December 4th, Mr. Wilson introduced a joint resolution for the release
of certain persons confined in the county jail for the County of
Washington in the District of Columbia, which was read a first and
second time. A debate ensued, in which the jail and the judiciary of
the District were severely handled. Mr. Hale hoped that Mr. Wilson,
who had introduced the resolution, would “pursue his inquiries further,
and find out where the cause of all this evil is, and apply the
remedy.” Mr. Fessenden, after calling attention to the administration
of justice in the District and hoping for an inquiry, concluded: “It is
well, perhaps, that we should begin here; it is a tangible point; but
I hope it will be followed up to any extent that may be necessary in
order to accomplish the purpose.” Mr. Sumner at once took advantage
of the debate, and turned it against Slavery and the Black Code.</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">MR. PRESIDENT,&mdash;The Senator from Maine [Mr.
Fessenden] has pointed to abuses of the judiciary
in this District, and he insists that at last we shall have
decent men on the bench. But that is not going far
enough, Sir. Something more is needed. We must
have decent laws. A Black Code still prevails in this
District, imported from the old legislation of Maryland,
which is a shame to the civilization of our age. If any
one wishes to know why such abuses exist in prisons
and in courts as have been so eloquently portrayed, I
refer him to that Black Code. There you will find<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</a></span>
apology for every outrage. If, therefore, Senators are
really in earnest, if they are determined that the national
capital shall be purified, that the administration of
justice here shall be worthy of a civilized community,
they must expunge that Black Code from the statute-book:
but to do this is to expunge Slavery itself; and
here we are brought precisely to the point.</p>

<p>Senators mistake, if they treat this question merely
on the outside. They must penetrate its interior. Why
is that prison so offensive as I know it to be?&mdash;for it
has been my fortune to visit it repeatedly. It is on
account of Slavery, with the Black Code, which is its
offspring. Why is justice so offensively administered
in this District? It is on account of those brutal
sentiments generated by Slavery, and manifested in
the Black Code, which the courts here but enforce.</p>

<p>I listened with gratitude to my distinguished friend
from New Hampshire [Mr. <span class="smcap">Hale</span>], when he reviewed
this subject, and announced that he would soon bring
in a bill to remove the evil. He did not tell us what
the bill would be; but the Senator is apt to be thorough.
I doubt not that he understands the case; but
I am sure, that, to meet it, he must deal directly with
Slavery, the fountain and origin of all the noisome inhumanity
exposed before us to-day.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>This was the first open word against Slavery in the District since the
breaking out of the Rebellion.</p>

<p>The resolution of Mr. Wilson was referred to the Committee on the
District of Columbia. He followed at once by another resolution,
which was referred to the same committee, where, among other things,
the committee was “instructed to consider the expediency of abolishing
Slavery in the District, with compensation to the loyal holders of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</a></span>
slaves.”</p>

<p>December 16th, Mr. Wilson introduced a bill “for the release of certain
persons held to service or labor in the District of Columbia,”
which was afterwards referred to the Committee on the District, who
reported it with amendments February 14, 1862. The further part
Mr. Sumner took on this question will appear hereafter.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_LATE_SENATOR_BINGHAM_WITH_PROTEST" id="THE_LATE_SENATOR_BINGHAM_WITH_PROTEST"></a>THE LATE SENATOR BINGHAM, WITH PROTEST
AGAINST SLAVERY.</h2>

<p class="plabeln"><span class="smcap">Speech in the Senate, on the Death of Hon. Kinsley S. Bingham,
late Senator of Michigan, December 10, 1861.</span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/line.png" width="80" height="16" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">MR. PRESIDENT,&mdash;There are Senators who knew
Mr. Bingham well, while he was a member of
the other House. I knew him well only when he
became a member of this body. Our seats here were
side by side, and, as he was constant in attendance,
I saw him daily. Our acquaintance soon became
friendship, quickened by common sympathies, and
confirmed by that bond which, according to the ancient
orator, is found in the <i>eadem de Republica sensisse</i>.<a name="FNanchor_240_240" id="FNanchor_240_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_240_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a>
In his death I have lost a friend; but the
sorrow of friendship is deepened, when I think of loss
to the country.</p>

<p>If he did not impress at once by personal appearance
or voice or manner, yet all these, as they became familiar,
testified continually to the unaffected simplicity
and integrity of his character. His life, so far as not
given to his country, was devoted to the labors of agriculture.
He was a farmer, and, amidst all the temptations
of an eminent public career, never abandoned this
vocation, which does so much to strengthen both body
and soul. More than merchant, manufacturer, or lawyer,
the agriculturist is independent in condition. To<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[Pg 365]</a></span>
him the sun and rain and the ever-varying seasons are
agents of prosperity. Dependent upon Nature, he learns
to be independent of men. Such a person, thus endowed,
easily turns from the behest of party to follow those
guiding principles which are kindred to the laws of
Nature. Of such a character our friend was a beautiful
example.</p>

<p>In him all the private virtues commingled. Truthful
and frank, he was full of gentleness and generous sympathy.
He had risen from humble fortunes, and his
heart throbbed warmly for all who suffered in any way.
Especially was he aroused against wrong and injustice,
wherever they appeared, and then his softer sentiments
were changed into an indomitable firmness,&mdash;showing
that he was one of those admirable natures
where</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Mildness and bravery went hand in hand.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>It was this character which gave elevation to his
public life. Though companions about him hesitated,
though great men on whom he had leaned apostatized,
he stood sure and true always for the Right. Such a
person was naturally enlisted against Slavery. His
virtuous soul recoiled from this many-headed Barbarism,
entering into and possessing the National Government.
His political philosophy was simply moral philosophy
applied to public affairs. Slavery was wrong;
therefore he was against it, wherever he could justly
reach it. No matter what form it took,&mdash;whether
of pretension or blandishment,&mdash;whether, like Satan,
stalking lordly, or sitting squat like a toad,&mdash;whether,
like Mephistopheles, cozening cunningly, or lurking
like a poodle,&mdash;whether, like Asmodeus, inquisitorial
even to lifting the roofs of the whole country,&mdash;he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[Pg 366]</a></span>
never deceived, but saw it always, in all its various
manifestations, as the Spirit of Evil, and was its constant
enemy. And now, among the signs that Freedom
has truly triumphed, is the fact that here, in this
Chamber, so long the stronghold of Slavery, our homage
can be freely offered to one who so fearlessly opposed
it.</p>

<p>There was something in our modest friend which
seemed peculiarly adapted to private life. Had he not
been a public man, he would have been, in his own
rural neighborhood, at home, the good citizen, active
and positive for human improvement, with an honored
place in that list whose praise Clarkson pronounces
so authoritatively. “I have had occasion,”
says this philanthropist, “to know many thousand persons
in the course of my travels, and I can truly say
that the part which these took on this great question
[of the Abolition of the Slave-Trade] was always a
true criterion of their moral character.”<a name="FNanchor_241_241" id="FNanchor_241_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_241_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a> But he was
not allowed to continue in retirement. His country
had need of him, and he became a member of the
Michigan Legislature and Speaker of its House, Representative
in Congress, Governor, and then Senator
of the United States. This distinguished career was
stamped always with the plainness of his character.
The Roman Cato was not more plain or determined.
He came into public life when Compromise was the
order of the day, but he never yielded to it. He
was a member of the Democratic party, which was
the declared tool of Slavery, but he never allowed
Slavery to make a tool of him. All this should now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[Pg 367]</a></span>
be spoken in his honor. To omit it on this occasion
would be to forget those titles by which hereafter he
will be most gratefully remembered.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>There were two important questions, while he was
a member of the other House, on which his name
is recorded for Freedom. The first was the famous
proposition introduced by Mr. Wilmot, of Pennsylvania,
for the prohibition of Slavery in the Territories.
On this question he separated from his party,
and courageously voted in the affirmative. Had his
voice at that time prevailed, Slavery would have been
checked, and the vast Conspiracy under which we
now suffer would have received an early death-blow.
The other question on which his record is so honorable
was the Fugitive Slave Bill. There his name is
found among the noes, in generous fellowship with
Preston King among the living, and Horace Mann
among the dead.</p>

<p>From that time forward his influence for Freedom
was felt in his own State, and when, at a later day, he
entered the Senate, he became known instantly as one
of our surest and most faithful Senators, whose inflexible
constancy was more eloquent than a speech.
During all recent trials he never for one moment
wavered. With the instincts of an honest statesman,
he saw the situation, and accepted frankly and bravely
the responsibilities of the hour. He set his face
against concession in any degree and in every form.
The time had come when Slavery was to be met, and
he was ready. As the Rebellion assumed its warlike
proportions, his perception of our duties was none the
less clear. In his mind, Slavery was not only the origin,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[Pg 368]</a></span>
but vital part of the Rebellion, and therefore to be
attacked. Slavery was also the mainspring of the belligerent
power now arrayed against the Union,&mdash;therefore,
in the name of the Union, to be destroyed. While
valuing the military arm as essential, he saw that
without courageous counsels it would be feeble. The
function of the statesman is higher than that of general;
and our departed Senator saw that on the counsels
of the Government, even more than on its armies,
rested the great responsibility of bringing this war to
a speedy and triumphant close. Armies obey orders,
but it is for the Government to organize and to inspire
victory. All this he saw clearly; and he longed
impatiently for that voice, herald of Union and Peace,
which, in behalf of a violated Constitution, and in the
exercise of a just self-defence, should change the present
contest from a bloody folly into a sure stage of
Human Improvement and an immortal landmark of
Civilization.</p>

<p>Such a Senator can be ill spared at this hour. His
cheerful confidence, his genuine courage, his practical
instinct, his simple presence, would help the great
events now preparing, nay, which are at hand. Happily
he survives in noble example, and speaks even
from the tomb. By all who have shared his counsels
he will ever be truly remembered, while the State
which trusted him so often in life, and the neighbors
who knew him so well in his daily walks, will cherish
his memory with affectionate pride. Marble and bronze
are not needed. If not enough for glory, he has done
too much to be forgotten; and hereafter, when our
country is fully redeemed, his name will be inscribed
in that faithful company, who, through good report<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[Pg 369]</a></span>
and evil report, held fast to the truth.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>This occasion was remarkable for the presence of President Lincoln,
thus described in the <i>Congressional Globe</i>:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The President of the United States entered the Senate Chamber, supported
by Hon. Lyman Trumbull and Hon. O. H. Browning, Senators from
the State of Illinois; he was introduced to the Vice-President, and took a
seat beside him on the daïs appropriated to the President of the Senate.
J. G. Nicolay, Esq., and John Hay, Esq., Private Secretaries to the President
of the United States, took seats near the central entrance.”</p>

</div>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">MR. PRESIDENT,&mdash;The Senator to whom we
now say farewell was generous in funeral homage
to others. More than once he held great companies in
rapt attention, while doing honor to the dead. Over
the coffin of Broderick<a name="FNanchor_243_243" id="FNanchor_243_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_243_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a> he proclaimed the dying utterance
of that early victim, and gave to it the fiery wings
of his own eloquence: “They have killed me because
I was opposed to the extension of Slavery, and a corrupt
Administration”; and as the impassioned orator
repeated these words, his own soul was knit in sympathy
with the departed; and thus at once did he win to
himself the friends of Freedom, though distant.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[Pg 371]</a></span></p>

</div>

<p>There are two forms of eminent talent which are
kindred in effect, each producing instant impression,
each holding crowds in suspense, and each kindling
enthusiastic admiration: I mean the talent of the orator
and the talent of the soldier. Each of these, when
successful, gains immediate honor, and reads his praise
in a nation’s eyes. Baker was orator and soldier. To
him belongs the rare renown of this double character.
Perhaps he carried into war something of the confidence
inspired by the conscious sway of great multitudes, as
he surely brought into speech something of the ardor
of war. Call him, if you will, the Rupert of battle; he
was also the Rupert of debate.</p>

<p>His success in life attests not only a remarkable
genius, but the benign hospitality of our institutions.
Born on a foreign soil, he was to our country only a
step-son; but, were he now alive, I doubt not he would
gratefully declare that the country was never to him
an ungentle step-mother. Child of poverty, he was
brought, while yet in tender years, to Philadelphia,
where he began life an exile. His earliest days were
passed at the loom rather than at school; and yet
from this lowliness he achieved the highest posts of
trust and honor, being at the same time Senator and
General. It was the boast of Pericles, in his funeral
oration, in the Ceramicus, over the dead who had fallen
in battle, that the Athenians readily communicated to
all the advantages which they themselves enjoyed, that
they did not exclude the stranger from their walls, and
that Athens was a city open to the Human Family.<a name="FNanchor_244_244" id="FNanchor_244_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_244_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a>
The same boast may be repeated by us with better reason,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[Pg 372]</a></span>
as we commemorate our dead fallen in battle.</p>

<p>From Philadelphia the poor man’s son was carried to
the West, where he grew with the growth of that surpassing
region. He became one of its children; and
his own manhood was closely associated with its powerful
progress. The honors of the bar and of Congress
were soon his; but impatient temper led him from
these paths into the Mexican War, where he gallantly
took the place of Shields&mdash;torn with wounds and almost
dead&mdash;at Cerro Gordo. But the great West, beginning
to teem with population, did not satisfy his
ambition, and he repaired to California. With infancy
rocked on the waves of the Atlantic, and manhood
formed in the broad and open expanse of the
Prairie, he now sought a home on the shores of the
Pacific. There again his genius was promptly recognized.
A new State, which had just taken its place
in the Union, sent him as Senator; and Oregon first
became truly known to us on this floor by his eloquent
lips.<a name="FNanchor_245_245" id="FNanchor_245_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_245_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a></p>

<p>In the Senate he took at once the part of orator. His
voice was not full and sonorous, but sharp and clear.
It was penetrating rather than commanding, and yet,
when touched by his ardent nature, became sympathetic
and even musical. Countenance, body, and gesture all
shared the unconscious inspiration of his voice, and he
went on, master of his audience, master also of himself.
All his faculties were completely at command.
Ideas, illustrations, words, seemed to come unbidden
and range in harmonious forms,&mdash;as in the walls of
ancient Thebes each stone took its proper place of its
own accord, moved only by the music of a lyre. His<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[Pg 373]</a></span>
fame as a speaker was so peculiar, even before he appeared
among us, that it was sometimes supposed he
might lack those solid powers without which the oratorical
faculty itself exercises only a transient influence.
But his speech on this floor in reply to a slaveholding
conspirator, now an open rebel, showed that his matter
was as good as his manner, and that, while master of
fence, he was also master of ordnance. His oratory was
graceful, sharp, and flashing, like a cimeter; but his argument
was powerful and sweeping, like a battery.</p>

<p>You have not forgotten that speech. Perhaps the
argument against the sophism of Secession was never
better arranged and combined, or more simply popularized
for general apprehension. A generation had passed
since that traitorous absurdity, fit cover of conspiracy,
was exposed. For a while it had shrunk into darkness,
driven back by the massive logic of Daniel Webster and
the honest sense of Andrew Jackson.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse indent6">“The times have been,</div>
<div class="verse">That, when the brains were out, the man would die,</div>
<div class="verse">And there an end; but now they rise again.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">As the pretension showed itself anew, our orator undertook
again to expose it. How thoroughly he did this,
now with historic and now with forensic skill, while his
whole effort was elevated by a charming, ever-ready eloquence,
aroused to new power by the interruptions he
encountered,&mdash;all this is present to your minds. That
speech passed at once into general acceptance, while it
gave its author an assured position in this body.</p>

<p>Another speech showed him in a different character.
It was his instant reply to the Kentucky Senator,<a name="FNanchor_246_246" id="FNanchor_246_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_246_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a>&mdash;not
then expelled from this body. The occasion was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[Pg 374]</a></span>
peculiar. A Senator, with treason in his heart, if not
on his lips, had just sat down. Our lamented Senator,
who had entered the Chamber direct from his camp,
rose at once to reply. He began simply and calmly;
but, as he proceeded, the fervid soul broke forth in
words of surpassing power. On the former occasion
he presented the well-ripened fruits of study; but
now he spoke with the spontaneous utterance of his
natural eloquence, meeting the polished traitor at every
point with weapons keener and brighter than his
own.</p>

<p>Not content with the brilliant opportunities of this
Chamber, he accepted a commission in the Army,
vaulting from the Senate to the saddle, as he had
already leaped from Illinois to California. With a
zeal that never tired, after recruiting men, drawn by
the attraction of his name, in New York, Philadelphia,
and elsewhere, he held his brigade in camp near the
Capitol, so that he passed easily from one to the other,
and thus alternated between the duties of Senator and
of General.</p>

<p>His latter career was short, though shining. At a
disastrous encounter near Ball’s Bluff, he fell, pierced
by nine balls. That brain, once the seat and organ of
subtile power, swaying assemblies, and giving to this
child of obscurity place and command among his fellow-men,
was now rudely shattered, and the bosom that
throbbed so bravely was rent by numerous wounds.
He died with his face to the foe,&mdash;and he died so
instantly, that he passed without pain from the service
of his country to the service of his God. It is
sweet and becoming to die for country. Such a death,
sudden, but not unprepared for, is the crown of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[Pg 375]</a></span>
patriot soldier.</p>

<p>But the question is painfully asked, Who was author
of this tragedy, now filling the Senate Chamber,
as already it has filled the country, with mourning?
There is a strong desire to hold somebody responsible,
where so many perished so unprofitably. But we need
not appoint committees, or study testimony, to know
precisely who took this precious life. That great criminal
is easily detected,&mdash;still erect and defiant, without
concealment or disguise. The guns, the balls, and the
men that fired them are of little importance. It is
the power behind all, saying, “The State, it is I,” that
took this precious life; and this power is Slavery. The
nine balls that slew our departed brother came from
Slavery. Every gaping wound of his slashed bosom
testifies against Slavery. Every drop of his generous
blood cries out from the ground against Slavery. The
brain so rudely shattered has its own voice, and the
tongue so suddenly silenced in death speaks now with
more than living eloquence. To hold others responsible
is to hold the dwarf agent and dismiss the giant principal.
Nor shall we do great service, if, merely criticizing
some local blunder, we leave untouched that fatal
forbearance through which the weakness of the Rebellion
is changed into strength, and the strength of our
armies is changed into weakness.</p>

<p>May our grief to-day be no hollow pageant, nor expend
itself in this funeral pomp! It must become a
motive and impulse to patriot action. But patriotism
itself, that commanding charity, embracing so many
other charities, is only a name, and nothing else, unless
we resolve, calmly, plainly, solemnly, that Slavery, the
barbarous enemy of our country, the irreconcilable foe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[Pg 376]</a></span>
of our Union, the violator of our Constitution, the disturber
of our peace, the vampire of our national life,
sucking its best blood, the assassin of our children, and
the murderer of our dead Senator, shall be struck down.
And the way is easy. The just avenger is at hand, with
weapon of celestial temper. Let it be drawn. Until
this is done, the patriot, discerning clearly the secret of
our weakness, can only say sorrowfully:&mdash;</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>The tributes to Bingham and Baker were accepted at the time as
more than eulogies. The protest against Slavery and the cry for
Emancipation were not lost. They were noticed extensively by the
press and by correspondents. The effect shows the development of
that sentiment before which Slavery was falling. A Philadelphia
newspaper, even while praising the eulogy on Senator Baker, seemed to
shrink from the demand with which it concluded.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The speech of Senator Sumner surpassed all others in powerful effect,
clear and manly style, and an undisguised expression of opinion which all
must respect, and which but few can condemn at the present juncture.
His learned eloquence captivated the heart, even where it did not convince
the judgment.”</p>

</div>

<p>Another recorded the impressions of a correspondent.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Mr. Sumner, in his splendid eulogy on Baker this morning, uttered a
stupendous thought, when, in commenting on the unfortunate reconnoissance
at Ball’s Bluff, he scoffed at the idea of an investigating committee to ascertain
where the blame should justly be charged, and said that the great
criminal stood before the country and the world, and that great criminal
was Slavery. You will have his words in print, and can judge of this point
for yourselves. I confess that it thrilled me like an electric shock.”</p>

</div>

<p>The <i>Antislavery Standard</i>, of New York, exulted that Slavery was
arraigned.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“To see men like Bright and Powell sit still, when Charles Sumner
charged Baker’s murder on Slavery, was worth at least ten years of Antislavery
privations. The Proslavery interest in the Senate is quite respectful,
and does not indulge in the old-time bluster and parade.”</p>

</div>

<p>On the contrary, the “Editorial Correspondent” of the <i>New York
Express</i>, writing on the day of the eulogy on Baker, gave vent to his
sentiments with regard to Mr. Sumner.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Even in the burial services of the dead he mingles his sectional hate
and personal wrath.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[Pg 378]</a></span>

<p>“Such a man will never consent to a peaceful reunion of the States, nor
to an equal representation of all the States in the Federal Congress. He
deeply wounds the self-sacrificing, loyal Union men of the Border States and
Far South; in every breath he utters, and in every speech he makes, he sets
back upon the clock of advancing time the hour-hand of Peace. His presence
in the Senate Chamber is a signal of protracted war, renewed sectional
hate, and offensive intermeddling.…</p>

<p>“If Massachusetts were to-day represented in the spirit of her early Revolutionary
men, or in the spirit in which so many thousands of her sons have
rushed to the defence of the country, Mr. Sumner, as a long standing enemy
of the Constitution and the Union, would be sent back to Boston, and there
sandwiched between Slidell and Mason within the casemates of Fort Warren.
These three men are each old acquaintances here, and each old enemies
of the Government, the Union, and the Constitution; and the only
difference between the extremes is, that the Senator from Boston remains in
council here to fight the Government, and men and institutions belonging to
it from its foundation, while the others fled from its service to render more
available aid to those in arms against it.”</p>

</div>

<p>Hon. Edward G. Parker, author of “The Golden Age of American
Oratory” and “Reminiscences of Rufus Choate,” wrote from Boston:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I thank you sincerely for a copy of your exquisite panegyrics on Bingham
and Baker. I often heard Baker, and recognize at once the beautiful
fidelity of your description.</p>

<p>“The touch of Plutarch and of Addison&mdash;both, if you will allow me to
say so&mdash;are there.</p>

<p>“I had, before receiving this, cut out of the newspaper your portrait of
Baker, and put it in a choice book devoted to great men and memorable
thoughts.</p>

<p>“It is to me like a medallion of that <em>true</em> man, who, in so shining a manner,
and yet so suddenly, ‘passed from the service of his country to the
service of his God.’</p>

<p>“Pardon what you may perhaps consider the superfluous enthusiasm of
this note; but it is written right away upon reading these oratoric odes, and
I feel a little of the <em>lava</em> struggling even in the attempt to acknowledge
receiving them.”</p>

</div>

<p>Hon. John Jay, afterwards Minister at Vienna, wrote from New
York:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“They are not only eloquent tributes to the dead, but powerful appeals to
the living.”</p>

</div>

<p>Epes Sargent, the friend and writer, showed his sympathy in a letter
from Boston.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Your remarks in the Senate on Senator Baker pleased me so much
that I could not forbear speaking my pleasure in print. They are level
with the theme and the time, and the trumpet-note at the close is in just the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[Pg 379]</a></span>right key. Oh, if it were not for Kentucky, that neither hot nor cold State,
we might hope for a policy up to the height of this great argument! ‘I
would she were hot or cold.’</p>

<p>“Our Boston papers do not yet speak out, as I would like to see them, on
this question of proclaiming emancipation to the slaves of Rebels. We need
another disaster to carry us forward a little further.”</p>

</div>

<p>William Lloyd Garrison declared himself with his accustomed directness
in a letter from Boston.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Thanks for your eloquent eulogy upon the late Senator Baker, (which
I have published in the <i>Liberator</i> this week,) and its forcible application
to Slavery as the primary cause of his untimely death, as it is of all our
national woes. Be in no wise daunted, but rather strengthened and stimulated,
by the abusive clamors and assaults following all your efforts, on the
part of the ‘Satanic press,’ and unprincipled demagogues generally. These
are surer evidences of the wisdom, goodness, and nobility of your cause
than all the praises of your numerous friends and admirers. You may confidently
make ‘the safe appeal of truth to time,’ and rely upon a universal
verdict of approval at no distant day. To be in the right is as surely to be
allied to victory as that God reigns. When there is howling in the pit,
there is special rejoicing in heaven.”</p>

alluded to the new hall in which he spoke, called after the founder of Providence,

and spacious hall, you pledge yourselves that here Toleration shall prevail,
and Liberty be a constant word. It was the gratulation of the Roman historian
in the days of the good Emperors, that he could think what he pleased
and speak what he thought. Should this privilege ever fail in your new
hall, or anywhere within its influence, then must you forget the great
example consecrated in the name of Roger Williams. With this privilege
securely established, you may proudly point to a higher token of civilization
than a column of the Roman Forum or a frieze of the Parthenon.”</p>

October 17, 1784, says: “The time I have lately passed with the Marquis has
given me a pretty thorough insight into his character. With great natural
frankness of temper he unites much address and very considerable talents.
In his politics, he says his three hobby-horses are the alliance between
France and the United States, the union of the latter, and the manumission of
the slaves.” (Madison’s Letters and other Writings, Vol. I. p. 106.) Call
these hobby-horses! They were three practical policies, having their foundation
in everlasting principles. How many of our own statesmen saw as
wisely?</p>

Crittenden were “proposed by the honorable Senator from Illinois” (Mr.
Douglas), although nothing in the <i>Congressional Globe</i> shows that the propositions
of Mr. Douglas offered to the Committee of Thirteen (<i>ante</i>, p. 433)
were ever before proposed in the Senate. Whatever their origin, they were
adopted by Mr. Crittenden, and became part of his Compromise. Of the
original copies printed for the Senate only a single copy <em>containing the important
additions</em> remains on the files. The propositions in their first form
are in the <i>Globe</i>, under date of December 18, 1860, p. 114, also in McPherson’s
<i>Political History of the Rebellion</i>, pp. 64, 65. They do not appear in
the <i>Globe</i> on reintroduction with additions, January 3, 1861, p. 237, but the
first addition is found at a later date, March 2, 1861, p. 1368, when they were
voted on. Nor do the additions appear in McPherson’s History. It is
proper that the disfranchisement of the colored race, where already voters,
should not be forgotten as one of the terms of this sacrifice.</p>

country, which speaks. More of the passage is applicable to Slavery: “Tu
non solum ad negligendas leges ac quæstiones, verum etiam ad evertendas
perfringendasque valuisti. Superiora illa, quamquam ferenda non fuerunt,
tamen, ut potui, tuli; nunc vero me totam esse in metu propter te unum.”
In the same spirit, Niebuhr, the great German, says of Catiline: “He was
so completely diabolical that I know of no one in history that can be compared
with him, and you may rely upon it that the colors in which his character
is described are not too dark.” (Lectures on the History of Rome, ed.
Schmitz, London, 1849, Vol. III. p. 13.) All of which, whether by Cicero
or Niebuhr, is true of Slavery.</p>
